  "page-10": "<h4>Preface</h4><p class=\" stretch-last-line start-chapter\">C. Suetonius Tranquillus was the son of a Roman knight who commanded a legion, on the side of Otho, at the battle which decided the fate of the empire in favour of Vitellius. From incidental notices in the following History, we learn that he was born towards the close of the reign of Vespasian, who died in the year 79 of the Christian era. He lived till the time of Hadrian, under whose administration he filled the office of secretary; until, with several others, he was dismissed for presuming on familiarities with the empress Sabina, of which we have no further account than that they were unbecoming his position in the</p>",
  "page-11": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">imperial court. How long he survived this disgrace, which appears to have befallen him in the year 121, we are not informed; but we find that the leisure afforded him by his retirement, was employed in the composition of numerous works, of which the only portions now extant are collected in the present volume.</p><p>Several of the younger Pliny’s letters are addressed to Suetonius, with whom he lived in the closest friendship. They afford some brief, but generally pleasant, glimpses of his habits and career; and in a letter, in which Pliny makes application on behalf of his friend to the emperor Trajan, for a mark of favour, he speaks of him as “a most excellent, honourable, and learned man, whom he had the pleasure of entertaining under his own roof, and with whom the nearer he was brought into communion, the more he loved him.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The plan adopted by Suetonius in his Lives of the Twelve Caesars, led him to be more diffuse on their</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">personal conduct and habits than on public events. He writes Memoirs rather than History. He neither dwells on the civil wars which sealed the fall of the Republic, nor on the military expeditions which extended the frontiers of the empire; nor does he attempt to develop the causes of the great political changes which marked the period of which he treats.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When we stop to gaze in a museum or gallery on the antique busts of the Caesars, we perhaps endeavour to trace in their sculptured physiognomy the characteristics of those princes, who, for good or evil, were in their times masters of the destinies of a large portion of the human race. The pages of Suetonius will amply gratify this natural curiosity. In them we find a series of individual portraits sketched to the life, with perfect truth and rigorous impartiality. La Harpe remarks of Suetonius, “He is scrupulously exact, and strictly methodical. He omits nothing which concerns</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the person whose life he is writing; he relates everything, but paints nothing. His work is, in some sense, a collection of anecdotes, but it is very curious to read and consult.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Combining as it does amusement and information, Suetonius’s “Lives of the Caesars” was held in such estimation, that, so soon after the invention of printing as the year 1500, no fewer than eighteen editions had been published, and nearly one hundred have since been added to the number. Critics of the highest rank have devoted themselves to the task of correcting and commenting on the text, and the work has been translated into most European languages. Of the English translations, that of Dr. Alexander Thomson, published in 1796, has been made the basis of the present. He informs us in his Preface, that a version of Suetonius was with him only a secondary object, his principal design being to form a just estimate of Roman</p>",
  "page-14": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">literature, and to elucidate the state of government, and the manners of the times; for which the work of Suetonius seemed a fitting vehicle. Dr. Thomson’s remarks appended to each successive reign, are reprinted nearly verbatim in the present edition. His translation, however, was very diffuse, and retained most of the inaccuracies of that of Clarke, on which it was founded; considerable care therefore has been bestowed in correcting it, with the view of producing, as far as possible, a literal and faithful version.</p><p>To render the works of Suetonius, as far as they are extant, complete, his Lives of eminent Grammarians, Rhetoricians, and Poets, of which a translation has not before appeared in English, are added. These Lives abound with anecdote and curious information connected with learning and literary men during the period of which the author treats.</p><p>T. F.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

Julius Caesar, The Divine , Lost His Father  When He Was In The Sixteenth Year Of His Age ; And The Year Following, Being Nominated To The Office Of High-priest Of Jupiter , He Repudiated Cossutia, Who Was Very Wealthy, Although Her Family Belonged Only To The Equestrian Order, And To Whom He Had Been Contracted When He Was A Mere Boy. He Then Married  Cornelia, The Daughter Of Cinna, Who Was Four Times Consul; And Had By Her, Shortly Afterwards, A Daughter Named Julia. Resisting All The Efforts Of The Dictator Sylla To Induce Him To Divorce Cornelia, He Suffered The Penalty Of Being Stripped Of His Sacerdotal Office, His Wife’s Dowry, And His Own Patrimonial Estates; And, Being Identified With The Adverse Faction , Was Compelled To Withdraw From Rome. After Changing His Place Of Concealment Nearly Every Night , Although He Was Suffering From A Quartan Ague, And Having Effected His Release By Bribing The Officers Who Had Tracked His Footsteps, He At Length Obtained A Pardon Through The Intercession Of The Vestal Virgins, And Of Mamercus Aemilius And Aurelius Cotta, His Near Relatives. We Are Assured That When Sylla, Having Withstood For A While The Entreaties Of His Own Best Friends, Persons Of Distinguished Rank, At Last Yielded To Their Importunity, He Exclaimed—either By A Divine Impulse, Or From A Shrewd Conjecture: “Your Suit Is Granted, And You May Take Him Among You; But Know,” He Added, “That This Man, For Whose Safety You Are So Extremely Anxious, Will, Some Day Or Other, Be The Ruin Of The Party Of The Nobles, In Defence Of Which You Are Leagued With Me; For In This One Caesar, You Will Find Many A Marius.”</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

While On His Voyage Thither, In The Winter Season, He Was Taken By Pirates Near The Island Of Pharmacusa , And Detained By Them, Burning With Indignation, For Nearly Forty Days; His Only Attendants Being A Physician And Two Chamberlains. For He Had Instantly Dispatched His Other Servants And The Friends Who Accompanied Him, To Raise Money For His Ransom . Fifty Talents Having Been Paid Down, He Was Landed On The Coast, When, Having Collected Some Ships , He Lost No Time In Putting To Sea In Pursuit Of The Pirates, And Having Captured Them, Inflicted Upon Them The Punishment With Which He Had Often Threatened Them In Jest. At That Time Mithridates Was Ravaging The Neighbouring Districts, And On Caesar’s Arrival At Rhodes, That He Might Not Appear To Lie Idle While Danger Threatened The Allies Of Rome, He Passed Over Into Asia, And Having Collected Some Auxiliary Forces, And Driven The King’s Governor Out Of The Province, Retained In Their Allegiance The Cities Which Were Wavering, And Ready To Revolt.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

For The Marcii Reges , Her Mother’s Family, Deduce Their Pedigree From Ancus Marcius, And The Julii, Her Father’s, From Venus; Of Which Stock We Are A Branch. We Therefore Unite In Our Descent The Sacred Majesty Of Kings, The Chiefest Among Men, And The Divine Majesty Of Gods, To Whom Kings Themselves Are Subject.” To Supply The Place Of Cornelia, He Married Pompeia, The Daughter Of Quintus Pompeius, And Grand-daughter Of Lucius Sylla; But He Afterwards Divorced Her, Upon Suspicion Of Her Having Been Debauched By Publius Clodius. For So Current Was The Report, That Clodius Had Found Access To Her Disguised As A Woman, During The Celebration Of A Religious Solemnity , That The Senate Instituted An Enquiry Respecting The Profanation Of The Sacred Rites.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He, Therefore, Immediately Sued For His Discharge, With The View Of Embracing The First Opportunity, Which Might Present Itself In The City, Of Entering Upon A More Exalted Career. In The Stillness Of The Night Following, He Dreamt That He Lay With His Own Mother; But His Confusion Was Relieved, And His Hopes Were Raised To The Highest Pitch, By The Interpreters Of His Dream, Who Expounded It As An Omen That He Should Possess Universal Empire; For  That The Mother Who In His Sleep He Had Found Submissive To His Embraces, Was No Other Than The Earth, The Common Parent Of All Mankind.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

For, Only A Few Days Before He Entered Upon The Aedileship, He Incurred A Suspicion Of Having Engaged In A Conspiracy With Marcus Crassus, A Man Of Consular Rank; To Whom Were Joined Publius Sylla And Lucius Autronius, Who, After They Had Been Chosen Consuls, Were Convicted Of Bribery. The Plan Of The Conspirators Was To Fall Upon The Senate At The Opening Of The New Year, And Murder As Many Of Them As Should Be Thought Necessary; Upon Which, Crassus Was To Assume The Office Of Dictator, And Appoint Caesar His Master Of The Horse . When The Commonwealth Had Been Thus Ordered According To Their Pleasure, The Consulship Was To Have Been Restored To Sylla And Autronius. Mention Is Made Of This Plot By Tanusius Geminus  In His History, By Marcus Bibulus In His Edicts , And By Curio, The Father, In His Orations . Cicero Likewise Seems To Hint At This In A Letter To Axius, Where He Says, That Caesar  Had In His Consulship Secured To Himself That Arbitrary Power  To Which He Had Aspired When He Was Edile. Tanusius Adds, That Crassus, From Remorse Or Fear, Did Not Appear Upon The Day Appointed For The Massacre Of The Senate; For Which Reason Caesar Omitted To Give The Signal, Which, According To The Plan Concerted Between Them, He Was To Have Made. The Agreement, Curio Says, Was That He Should Shake Off The Toga From His Shoulder. We Have The Authority Of The Same Curio, And Of M. Actorius Naso, For His Having Been Likewise Concerned In Another Conspiracy With Young Cneius Piso; To Whom, Upon A Suspicion Of Some Mischief Being Meditated In The City, The Province Of Spain Was Decreed Out Of The Regular Course . It Is Said To Have Been Agreed Between Them, That Piso Should Head A Revolt In The Provinces, Whilst The Other Should Attempt To Stir Up An Insurrection At Rome, Using As Their Instruments The Lambrani, And The Tribes Beyond The Po. But The Execution Of This Design Was Frustrated In Both Quarters By The Death Of Piso.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Entertained Them With The Hunting Of Wild Beasts, And With Games, Both Alone And In Conjunction With His Colleague. On This Account, He Obtained The Whole Credit Of The Expense To Which They Had Jointly Contributed; Insomuch That His Colleague, Marcus Bibulus, Could Not Forbear Remarking, That He Was Served In The Manner Of Pollux. For As The Temple  Erected In The Forum To The Two Brothers, Went By The Name Of Castor Alone, So His And Caesar’s Joint Munificence Was Imputed To The Latter Only. To The Other Public Spectacles Exhibited To The People, Caesar Added A Fight Of Gladiators, But With Fewer Pairs Of Combatants Than He Had Intended. For He Had Collected From All Parts So Great A Company Of Them, That His Enemies Became Alarmed; And A Decree Was Made, Restricting The Number Of Gladiators Which Any One Was Allowed To Retain At Rome.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

This Was Generally Resented; But, Notwithstanding, There Was So Much Opposition From The Faction Of The Nobles, That He Could Not Carry His Point. In Order, Therefore, To Diminish Their Influence By Every Means In His Power, He Restored The Trophies Erected In Honour Of Caius Marius, On Account Of His Victories Over Jugurtha, The Cimbri, And The Teutoni, Which Had Been Demolished By Sylla; And When Sitting In Judgment Upon Murderers, He Treated Those As Assassins, Who, In The Late Proscription, Had Received Money From The Treasury, For Bringing In The Heads Of Roman Citizens, Although They Were Expressly Excepted In The Cornelian Laws.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Persisted, However, In Obstructing The Measure, Until A Body Of The Roman Knights, Who Stood Under Arms As A Guard, Threatened Him With Instant Death, If He Continued His Determined Opposition.

Amidst Such A Series Of Successes, He Experienced Thrice Only Any Signal Disaster; Once In Britain, When His Fleet Was Nearly Wrecked In A Storm; In Gaul, At Gergovia, Where One Of His Legions Was Put To The Rout; And In The Territory Of The Germans, His Lieutenants Titurius And Aurunculeius Were Cut Off By An Ambuscade.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Having Attained This Object, Carrying His Views Still Higher, And Animated With The Hopes Of Success, He Omitted No  Opportunity Of Gaining Universal Favour, By Acts Of Liberality And Kindness To Individuals, Both In Public And Private. With Money Raised From The Spoils Of The War, He Began To Construct A New Forum, The Ground-plot Of Which Cost Him Above A Hundred Millions Of Sesterces . He Promised The People A Public Entertainment Of Gladiators, And A Feast In Memory Of His Daughter, Such As No One Before Him Had Ever Given. The More To Raise Their Expectations On This Occasion, Although He Had Agreed With Victuallers Of All Denominations For His Feast, He Made Yet Farther Preparations In Private Houses. He Issued An Order, That The Most Celebrated Gladiators, If At Any Time During The Combat They Incurred The Displeasure Of The Public, Should Be Immediately Carried Off By Force, And Reserved For Some Future Occasion. Young Gladiators He Trained Up, Not In The School, And By The Masters, Of Defence, But In The Houses Of Roman Knights, And Even Senators, Skilled In The Use Of Arms, Earnestly Requesting Them, As Appears From His Letters, To Undertake The Discipline Of Those Novitiates, And To Give Them The Word During Their Exercises. He Doubled The Pay Of The Legions In Perpetuity; Allowing Them Likewise Corn, When It Was In Plenty, Without Any Restriction; And Sometimes Distributing To Every Soldier In His Army A Slave, And A Portion Of Land.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Offered Also Singular And Ready Aid To All Who Were Under Prosecution, Or In Debt, And To Prodigal Youths; Excluding From  His Bounty Those Only Who Were So Deeply Plunged In Guilt, Poverty, Or Luxury, That It Was Impossible Effectually To Relieve Them.

He Likewise Embellished With Magnificent Public Buildings The Most Powerful Cities Not Only Of Italy, Gaul, And Spain, But Of Greece And Asia; Until All People Being Now Astonished, And Speculating On The Obvious Tendency Of These Proceedings, Claudius Marcellus, The Consul, Declaring First By Proclamation, That He Intended To Propose A Measure Of The Utmost Importance To The State, Made A Motion In The Senate That Some Person Should Be Appointed To Succeed Caesar In His Province, Before The Term Of His Command Was Expired; Because The War Being Brought To A Conclusion, Peace Was Restored, And The Victorious Army Ought To Be Disbanded. He Further Moved, That Caesar Being Absent, His Claims To Be A Candidate At The Next Election Of Consuls Should Not Be Admitted, As Pompey Himself Had Afterwards Abrogated That Privilege By A Decree Of The People. The Fact Was, That Pompey, In His Law Relating To The Choice Of Chief Magistrates, Had Forgot To Except Caesar, In The Article In Which He Declared All Such As Were Not Present Incapable Of Being Candidates For Any Office; But Soon Afterwards, When The Law Was Inscribed On Brass, And Deposited In The Treasury, He Corrected His Mistake. Marcellus, Not Content With Depriving Caesar Of His Provinces, And The Privilege Intended Him By Pompey, Likewise Moved The Senate, That The Freedom Of The City Should Be Taken From Those Colonists Whom, By The Vatinian Law, He Had Settled At New Como ; Because It Had Been Conferred Upon Them With Ambitious Views, And By A Stretch Of The Laws.</h4>",

Roused by these proceedings, and thinking, as he was often heard to say, that it would be a more difficult enterprise to reduce him, now that he was the chief man in the state, from the first rank of citizens to the second, than from the second to the lowest of all, Caesar made a vigorous opposition to the measure, partly by means of the tribunes, who interposed in his behalf, and partly through Servius Sulpicius, the other consul. The following year likewise, when Caius Marcellus, who succeeded his cousin Marcus in the consulship, pursued the same course, Caesar, by means of an immense bribe, engaged in his defence Aemilius Paulus, the other consul, and Caius</p>",

At the same time, he made his adversaries an offer to disband eight of his legions and give up Transalpine-Gaul, upon condition that he might retain two legions, with the Cisalpine province, or but one legion with Illyricum, until he should be elected consul.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

But As The Senate Declined To Interpose In The Business, And His Enemies Declared That They Would Enter Into No Compromise Where The Safety Of The Republic Was At Stake, He Advanced Into Hither-gaul , And, Having Gone The Circuit For The Administration Of Justice, Made A Halt At Ravenna, Resolved To Have Recourse To Arms If The Senate Should Proceed To Extremity Against The Tribunes Of The People Who Had Espoused His Cause. This Was Indeed His Pretext For The Civil War; But It Is Supposed That There Were Other Motives For His Conduct. Cneius Pompey Used Frequently To Say, That He Sought To Throw Every Thing Into Confusion, Because He Was Unable, With All His Private Wealth, To Complete The Works He Had Begun, And Answer, At His Return, The Vast Expectations Which He Had Excited In The People. Others Pretend That He Was Apprehensive Of Being  Called To Account For What He Had Done In His First Consulship, Contrary To The Auspices, Laws, And The Protests Of The Tribunes; Marcus Cato Having Sometimes Declared, And That, Too, With An Oath, That He Would Prefer An Impeachment Against Him, As Soon As He Disbanded His Army. A Report Likewise Prevailed, That If He Returned As A Private Person, He Would, Like Milo, Have To Plead His Cause Before The Judges, Surrounded By Armed Men. This Conjecture Is Rendered Highly Probable By Asinius Pollio, Who Informs Us That Caesar, Upon Viewing The Vanquished And Slaughtered Enemy In The Field Of Pharsalia, Expressed Himself In These Very Words: “This Was Their Intention: I, Caius Caesar, After All The Great Achievements I Had Performed, Must Have Been Condemned, Had I Not Summoned The Army To My Aid!” Some Think, That Having Contracted From Long Habit An Extraordinary Love Of Power, And Having Weighed His Own And His Enemies’ Strength, He Embraced That Occasion Of Usurping The Supreme Power; Which Indeed He Had Coveted From The Time Of His Youth.

Coming Up With His Troops On The Banks Of The Rubicon, Which Was The Boundary Of His Province , He Halted For A While, And, Revolving In His Mind The Importance Of The Step He Was On The Point Of Taking, He Turned To Those About Him, And Said: “We May Still Retreat; But If We Pass This Little Bridge, Nothing Is Left For Us But To Fight It Out In Arms.”</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

After Vain Attempts, By All The Obstacles He Could Oppose, To Prevent Their Leaving The Harbour, He Turned His Steps Towards Rome, Where He Appealed To The Senate On The Present State Of Public Affairs; And Then Set Out For Spain, In Which Province Pompey Had A Numerous Army, Under The Command Of Three Lieutenants, Marcus Petreius, Lucius Afranius, And Marcus Varro; Declaring Amongst His Friends, Before He Set Forward, “That He Was Going Against An Army Without A General, And Should Return Thence Against A General Without An Army.” Though His Progress Was Retarded Both By The Siege Of Marseilles, Which Shut Her Gates Against Him, And A Very Great Scarcity Of Corn, Yet In A Short Time He Bore Down All Before Him.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

It Was Winter, And He, Within The Walls Of A Well-provided And Subtle Enemy, Was Destitute Of Every Thing, And Wholly Unprepared  For Such A Conflict. He Succeeded, However, In His Enterprise, And Put The Kingdom Of Egypt Into The Hands Of Cleopatra And Her Younger Brother; Being Afraid To Make It A Province, Lest, Under An Aspiring Prefect, It Might Become The Centre Of Revolt. From Alexandria He Went Into Syria, And Thence To Pontus, Induced By Intelligence Which He Had Received Respecting Pharnaces. This Prince, Who Was Son Of The Great Mithridates, Had Seized The Opportunity Which The Distraction Of The Times Offered For Making War Upon His Neighbours, And His Insolence And Fierceness Had Grown With His Success. Caesar, However, Within Five Days After Entering His Country, And Four Hours After Coming In Sight Of Him, Overthrew Him In One Decisive Battle. Upon Which, He Frequently Remarked To Those About Him The Good Fortune Of Pompey, Who Had Obtained His Military Reputation, Chiefly, By Victory Over So Feeble An Enemy.

In Every Encounter With The Enemy Where He Himself Commanded, He Came Off With Complete Success; Nor Was The Issue Ever Doubtful, Except On Two Occasions: Once At Dyrrachium, When, Being Obliged To Give Ground, And Pompey Not Pursuing His Advantage, He Said That “Pompey Knew Not How To Conquer;” The Other Instance Occurred In His Last Battle In Spain, When, Despairing Of The Event, He Even Had Thoughts Of Killing Himself.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Many Persons Expressing Their Surprise At The Lowness Of The Price, Cicero Wittily Remarked, “To Let You Know The Real Value Of The Purchase, Between Ourselves, Tertia Was Deducted:” For Servilia Was Supposed To Have Prostituted Her Daughter Tertia To Caesar.</h4>",

He Afterwards Invited Her To Rome, Whence He Sent Her Back Loaded With Honours And Presents, And Gave Her Permission To Call By His Name A Son, Who, According To The Testimony Of Some Greek Historians, Resembled Caesar Both In Person And Gait. Mark Antony Declared In The Senate, That Caesar Had Acknowledged The Child As His Own; And That Caius Matias, Caius Oppius, And The Rest Of Caesar’s Friends Knew It To Be True. On Which Occasion, Oppius, As If It Had Been An Imputation Which He Was Called Upon To Refute, Published A Book To Shew, “That The Child Which Cleopatra Fathered Upon Caesar, Was Not His.” Helvius Cinna, Tribune Of The People, Admitted To Several Persons The Fact, That He Had A Bill Ready Drawn, Which Caesar Had Ordered Him To Get Enacted In His Absence, Allowing Him, With The Hope Of Leaving Issue, To Take Any Wife He Chose, And As Many Of Them As He Pleased; And To Leave No Room For Doubt Of His Infamous Character For Unnatural Lewdness And Adultery, Curio, The Father, Says, In One Of His Speeches, “He Was Every Woman’s Man, And Every Man’s Woman.”</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

In Gaul, He Rifled The Chapels And Temples Of The Gods, Which Were Filled With Rich Offerings, And Demolished Cities Oftener For The Sake Of Their Spoil, Than For Any Ill They Had Done. By This Means Gold Became So Plentiful With Him, That He Exchanged It Through Italy And The Provinces Of The Empire For Three Thousand Sesterces The Pound. In His First Consulship He Purloined From The Capitol Three Thousand Pounds’ Weight Of Gold, And Substituted For It The Same Quantity Of Gilt Brass. He Bartered Likewise To Foreign Nations And Princes, For Gold, The Titles Of Allies And Kings; And Squeezed Out Of Ptolemy Alone Near Six Thousand Talents, In The Name Of Himself And Pompey.

After His Prosecution Of Dolabella, He Was Indisputably Reckoned One Of The Most Distinguished Advocates. Cicero, In Recounting To Brutus The Famous Orators, Declares, “That He Does Not See That Caesar Was Inferior To Any One Of Them;” And Says, “That He  Had An Elegant, Splendid, Noble, And Magnificent Vein Of Eloquence.” And In A Letter To Cornelius Nepos, He Writes Of Him In The Following Terms: “What! Of All The Orators, Who, During The Whole Course Of Their Lives, Have Done Nothing Else, Which Can You Prefer To Him? Which Of Them Is More Pointed Or Terse In His Periods, Or Employs More Polished And Elegant Language?” In His Youth, He Seems To Have Chosen Strabo Caesar For His Model; From Whose Oration In Behalf Of The Sardinians He Has Transcribed Some Passages Literally Into His Divination. In His Delivery He Is Said To Have Had A Shrill Voice, And His Action Was Animated, But Not Ungraceful. He Has Left Behind Him Some Speeches, Among Which Are Ranked A Few That Are Not Genuine, Such As That On Behalf Of Quintus Metellus. These Augustus Supposes, With Reason, To Be Rather The Production Of Blundering Short-hand Writers, Who Were Not Able To Keep Pace With Him In The Delivery, Than Publications Of His Own. For I Find In Some Copies That The Title Is Not “For Metellus,” But “What He Wrote To Metellus;” Whereas The Speech Is Delivered In The Name Of Caesar, Vindicating Metellus And Himself From The Aspersions Cast Upon Them By Their Common Defamers. The Speech Addressed “To His Soldiers In Spain,” Augustus Considers Likewise As Spurious. We Meet With Two Under This Title; One Made, As Is Pretended, In The First Battle, And The Other In The Last; At Which Time, Asinius Pollio Says, He Had Not Leisure To Address The Soldiers, On Account Of The Suddenness Of The Enemy’s Attack.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Has Likewise Left Commentaries Of His Own Actions Both In The War In Gaul, And In The Civil War With Pompey; For The Author Of The Alexandrian, African, And Spanish Wars Is Not Known With Any Certainty. Some Think They Are The Production Of Oppius, And Some Of Hirtius; The Latter Of Whom Composed The Last Book, Which Is Imperfect, Of The Gallic War. Of Caesar’s Commentaries, Cicero, In His Brutus, Speaks Thus: “He Wrote His Commentaries In A Manner Deserving Of Great Approbation: They Are Plain, Precise, And Elegant, Without Any Affectation Of Rhetorical Ornament. In Having Thus Prepared Materials For Others Who Might Be Inclined To Write His History, He May Perhaps Have Encouraged Some Silly Creatures To Enter Upon Such A Work, Who Will Needs Be Dressing Up His Actions In All The Extravagance A  Bombast; But He Has Discouraged Wise Men From Ever Attempting The Subject.” Hirtius Delivers His Opinion Of These Commentaries In The Following Terms: “So Great Is The Approbation With Which They Are Universally Perused, That, Instead Of Rousing, He Seems To Have Precluded, The Efforts Of Any Future Historian. Yet, With Respect To This Work, We Have More Reason To Admire Him Than Others; For They Only Know How Well And Correctly He Has Written, But We Know, Likewise, How Easily And Quickly He Did It.” Pollio Asinius Thinks That They Were Not Drawn Up With Much Care, Or With A Due Regard To Truth; For He Insinuates That Caesar Was Too Hasty Of Belief In Regard To What Was Performed By Others Under His Orders; And That, He Has Not Given A Very Faithful Account Of His Own Acts, Either By Design, Or Through Defect Of Memory; Expressing At The Same Time An Opinion That Caesar Intended A New And More Correct Edition. He Has Left Behind Him Likewise Two Books On Analogy, With The Same Number Under The Title Of Anti-cato, And A Poem Entitled The Itinerary. Of These Books, He Composed The First Two In His Passage Over The Alps, As He Was Returning To The Army After Making His Circuit In Hither-gaul; The Second Work About The Time Of The Battle Of Munda; And The Last During The Four-and-twenty Days He Employed In His Journey From Rome To Farther-spain. There Are Extant Some Letters Of His To The Senate, Written In A Manner Never Practised By Any Before Him; For They Are Distinguished Into Pages In The Form Of A Memorandum Book Whereas The Consuls And Commanders Till Then, Used Constantly In Their Letters To Continue The Line Quite Across The Sheet, Without Any Folding Or Distinction Of Pages. There Are Extant Likewise Some Letters From Him To Cicero, And Others To His Friends, Concerning His Domestic Affairs; In Which, If There Was Occasion For Secrecy, He Wrote In Cyphers; That Is, He Used The Alphabet In Such A Manner, That Not A Single Word Could Be Made Out. The Way To Decipher Those Epistles Was To Substitute The Fourth For The First Letter, As D For A, And So For The Other Letters Respectively. Some Things Likewise Pass Under His Name, Said To Have Been Written By Him When A Boy, Or A Very Young Man; As The Encomium Of Hercules, A Tragedy Entitled Oedipus, And A Collection Of Apophthegms; All Which Augustus Forbad To Be Published, In A Short And Plain Letter To Pompeius Macer, Who Was Employed By Him In The Arrangement Of His Libraries.</h4>",

He Then Was Of Opinion, That The Oftener He Had Been Crowned With Success, The Less He Ought To Expose Himself To New Hazards; And That Nothing He Could Gain By A Victory Would Compensate For What He Might Lose By A Miscarriage. He Never Defeated The Enemy Without Driving Them From Their Camp; And Giving Them No Time To Rally Their Forces.

Let None Of You, Therefore, Presume To Make Further Enquiry, Or Indulge In Conjectures, But Take My Word For What I Tell You, Which I Have From Undoubted Intelligence; Otherwise I Shall Put Them Aboard An Old Crazy Vessel, And Leave Them Exposed To The Mercy Of The Winds, To Be Transported To Some Other Country.”</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Loved His Troops To Such A Degree, That When He Heard Of The Defeat Of Those Under Titurius, He Neither Cut His Hair Nor Shaved His Beard, Until He Had Revenged It Upon The Enemy; By Which Means He Engaged Their Devoted Affection, And Raised Their Valour To The Highest Pitch.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

No One Of Them, During The Whole Course Of The War, Deserted To The Enemy; And Many Of Those Who Were Made Prisoners, Though They Were Offered Their Lives, Upon Condition Of Bearing Arms Against Him, Refused To Accept The Terms. They Endured Want, And Other Hardships, Not Only  When They Were Besieged Themselves, But When They Besieged Others, To Such A Degree, That Pompey, When Blocked Up In The Neighbourhood Of Dyrrachium, Upon Seeing A Sort Of Bread Made Of An Herb, Which They Lived Upon, Said, “I Have To Do With Wild Beasts,” And Ordered It Immediately To Be Taken Away; Because, If His Troops Should See It, Their Spirit Might Be Broken By Perceiving The Endurance And Determined Resolution Of The Enemy. With What Bravery They Fought, One Instance Affords Sufficient Proof; Which Is, That After An Unsuccessful Engagement At Dyrrachium, They Called For Punishment; Insomuch That Their General Found It More Necessary To Comfort Than To Punish Them. In Other Battles, In Different Quarters, They Defeated With Ease Immense Armies Of The Enemy, Although They Were Much Inferior To Them In Number.

So sudden a transition from prosperity to the ruin of public freedom, without the intervention of any foreign enemy, excites a reasonable conjecture, that the constitution in which it could take place, however vigorous in appearance, must have lost that soundness of political health which had enabled it to endure through so many ages. A short view of its preceding state, and of that in which it was at the time of the revolution now mentioned, will best ascertain the foundation of such a conjecture.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Though the Romans, upon the expulsion of Tarquin, made an essential change in the political form of the state, they did not carry their detestation of regal authority so far as to abolish the religious institutions of Numa Pompilius, the second of their kings, according to which, the priesthood, with all the influence annexed to that order, was placed in the hands of the aristocracy.</p>",
  "page-121": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">By this wise policy a restraint was put upon the fickleness and violence of the people in matters of government, and a decided superiority given to the Senate both in the deliberative and executive parts of administration. This advantage was afterwards indeed diminished by the creation of Tribunes of the people; a set of men whose ambition often embroiled the Republic in civil dissensions, and who at last abused their authority to such a degree, that they became instruments of aggrandizement to any leading men in the state who could purchase their friendship. In general, however, the majority of the Tribunes being actuated by views which comprehended the interests of the multitude, rather than those of individuals, they did not so much endanger the liberty, as they interrupted the tranquillity, of the public; and when the occasional commotions subsided, there remained no permanent ground for the establishment of personal usurpation.</p>",
  "page-122": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In every government, an object of the last importance to the peace and welfare of society is the morals of the people; and in proportion as a community is enlarged by propagation, or the accession of a multitude of new members, a more strict attention is requisite to guard against that dissolution of manners to which a crowded and extensive capital has a natural tendency. Of this  the Romans became sensible in the growing state of the Republic. In the year of the City 312, two magistrates were first created for taking an account of the number of the people, and the value of their estates; and soon after, they were invested with the authority not only of inspecting the morals of individuals, but of inflicting public censure for any licentiousness of conduct, or violation of decency. Thus both the civil and religious institutions concurred to restrain the people within the bounds of good order and obedience to the laws; at the same time that the</p>",

The veneration for the constitution, usually a powerful check to treasonable designs, had been lately violated by the usurpations of Marius and Sylla. The salutary terrors of religion no longer predominated over the consciences of men. The shame of public censure was extinguished in general depravity. An eminent historian, who lived at that time, informs us, that venality universally prevailed amongst the Romans; and a writer who flourished soon after, observes, that luxury and dissipation had encumbered almost all so much with debt, that they beheld with a degree of complacency the prospect of civil war and confusion.</p>",
  "page-124": "<p>The extreme degree of profligacy at which the Romans were now arrived is in nothing more evident, than that this age gave birth to the most horrible conspiracy which occurs in the annals of humankind, viz. that of Catiline. This was not the project of a few desperate and abandoned individuals, but of a number of men of the most illustrious rank in the state; and it appears beyond doubt, that Julius Caesar was accessary to the design, which was no less than to extirpate the Senate, divide amongst themselves both the public and private treasures, and set Rome on fire. The causes which prompted to this tremendous project, it is generally admitted, were luxury, prodigality, irreligion, a total corruption of manners, and above all, as the immediate cause, the pressing necessity in which the conspirators were involved by their extreme dissipation.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The enormous debt in which Caesar himself was early involved, countenances an opinion that his anxiety</p>",
  "page-125": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">to procure the province of Gaul proceeded chiefly from this cause. But during nine years in which he held that province, he acquired such riches as must have rendered him, without competition, the most opulent person in the state. If nothing more, therefore, than a  splendid establishment had been the object of his pursuit, he had attained to the summit of his wishes. But when we find him persevering in a plan of aggrandizement beyond this period of his fortunes, we can ascribe his conduct to no other motive than that of outrageous ambition. He projected the building of a new Forum at Rome, for the ground only of which he was to pay 800,000 pounds; he raised legions in Gaul at his own charges: he promised such entertainments to the people as had never been known at Rome from the foundation of the city. All these circumstances evince some latent design of procuring such a popularity as might give him an uncontrolled influence in the management of public</p>",
  "page-126": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">affairs. Pompey, we are told, was wont to say, that Caesar not being able, with all his riches, to fulfil the promises which he had made, wished to throw everything into confusion. There may have been some foundation for this remark: but the opinion of Cicero is more probable, that Caesar’s mind was seduced with the temptations of chimerical glory. It is observable that neither Cicero nor Pompey intimates any suspicion that Caesar was apprehensive of being impeached for his conduct, had he returned to Rome in a private station. Yet, that there was reason for such an apprehension, the positive declaration of L. Domitius leaves little room to doubt: especially when we consider the number of enemies that Caesar had in the Senate, and the coolness of his former friend Pompey ever after the death of Julia. The proposed impeachment was founded upon a notorious charge of prosecuting measures destructive of the interests of the commonwealth, and tending</p>",
  "page-127": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ultimately to an object incompatible with public freedom. Indeed, considering the extreme corruption which prevailed amongst the Romans at this time, it is more than probable that Caesar would have been acquitted of the charge, but at such an expense as must have stripped him of all his riches, and placed him again in a situation ready to attempt a disturbance of the public tranquillity. For it is said, that he purchased the friendship of Curio, at the commencement of the civil war, with a bribe little short of half a million sterling.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Whatever Caesar’s private motive may have been for taking arms against his country, he embarked in an enterprise of a nature the most dangerous: and had Pompey conducted himself in any degree suitable to the reputation which he had formerly acquired, the contest would in all probability have terminated in favour of public freedom. But by dilatory measures in the beginning, by imprudently withdrawing his army from</p>",
  "page-128": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Italy into a distant province, and by not pursuing the advantage he had gained by the vigorous repulse of Caesar’s troops in their attack upon his camp, this commander lost every opportunity of extinguishing a war which was to determine the fate, and even the existence, of the Republic. It was accordingly determined on the plains of Pharsalia, where Caesar obtained a victory which was not more decisive than unexpected. He was now no longer amenable either to the tribunal of the Senate or the power of the laws, but triumphed at once over his enemies and the constitution of his country.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It is to the honour of Caesar, that when he had obtained the supreme power, he exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by those who had fought on the side of the Republic. Of his private life either before or after this period, little is transmitted in history. Henceforth,</p>",
  "page-129": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">however, he seems to have lived chiefly at Rome, near which he had a small villa, upon an eminence, commanding a beautiful prospect. His time was almost entirely occupied with public affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many agents, he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister. He was in general easy of access: but Cicero, in a letter to a friend, complains of having been treated with the indignity of waiting a considerable time amongst a crowd in an anti-chamber, before he could have an audience. The elevation of Caesar placed him not above discharging reciprocally the social duties in the intercourse of life. He returned the visits of those who waited upon him, and would sup at their houses. At table, and in the use of wine, he was habitually temperate. Upon the whole, he added nothing to his own happiness by all the dangers, the fatigues, and the perpetual anxiety which he had incurred in the pursuit</p>",
  "page-130": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of unlimited power. His health was greatly impaired: his former cheerfulness of temper, though not his magnanimity, appears to have forsaken him; and we behold in his fate a memorable example of illustrious talents rendered, by inordinate ambition, destructive to himself, and irretrievably pernicious to his country.</p><p>From beholding the ruin of the Roman Republic, after intestine divisions, and the distractions of civil war, it will afford some relief to take a view of the progress of literature, which flourished even during those calamities.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The commencement of literature in Rome is to be dated from the reduction of the Grecian States, when the conquerors imported into their own country the valuable productions of the Greek language, and the first essay of Roman genius was in dramatic composition. Livius Andronicus, who flourished about 240 years before the Christian aera, formed the</p>",
  "page-131": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Fescennine verses into a kind of regular drama, upon the model of the Greeks. He was followed some time after by Ennius, who, besides dramatic and other compositions,  wrote the annals of the Roman Republic in heroic verse. His style, like that of Andronicus, was rough and unpolished, in conformity to the language of those times; but for grandeur of sentiment and energy of expression, he was admired by the greatest poets in the subsequent ages. Other writers of distinguished reputation in the dramatic department were Naevius, Pacuvius, Plautus, Afranius, Caecilius, Terence, Accius, etc. Accius and Pacuvius are mentioned by Quintilian as writers of extraordinary merit. Of twenty-five comedies written by Plautus, the number transmitted to posterity is nineteen; and of a hundred and eight which Terence is said to have translated from Menander, there now remain only six. Excepting a few inconsiderable fragments, the writings of all the other</p>",
  "page-132": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">authors have perished. The early period of Roman literature was distinguished for the introduction of satire by Lucilius, an author celebrated for writing with remarkable ease, but whose compositions, in the opinion of Horace, though Quintilian thinks otherwise, were debased with a mixture of feculency. Whatever may have been their merit, they also have perished, with the works of a number of orators, who adorned the advancing state of letters in the Roman Republic. It is observable, that during this whole period, of near two centuries and a half, there appeared not one historian of eminence sufficient to preserve his name from oblivion.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Julius Caesar himself is one of the most eminent writers of the age in which he lived. His commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars are written with a purity, precision, and perspicuity, which command approbation. They are elegant without affectation, and</p>",
  "page-133": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">beautiful without ornament. Of the two books which he composed on Analogy, and those under the title of Anti-Cato, scarcely any fragment is preserved; but we may be assured of the justness of the observations on language, which were made by an author so much distinguished by the excellence of his own compositions. His poem entitled The Journey, which was probably an entertaining narrative, is likewise totally lost.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The most illustrious prose writer of this or any other age is M. Tullius Cicero; and as his life is copiously related in biographical works, it will be sufficient to mention his writings. From his earliest years, he applied himself with unremitting assiduity to the cultivation of literature, and, whilst he was yet a boy, wrote a poem, called Glaucus Pontius, which was extant in Plutarch’s time. Amongst his juvenile productions was a translation into Latin verse, of Aratus on the</p>",
  "page-134": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Phaenomena of the Heavens; of which many fragments are still extant. He also published a poem of the heroic kind, in honour of his countryman C. Marius, who was born at Arpinum, the birth-place of Cicero.  This production was greatly admired by Atticus; and old Scaevola was so much pleased with it, that in an epigram written on the subject, he declares that it would live as long as the Roman name and learning subsisted. From a little specimen which remains of it, describing a memorable omen given to Marina from an oak at Arpinum, there is reason to believe that his poetical genius was scarcely inferior to his oratorical, had it been cultivated with equal industry. He published another poem called Limon, of which Donatus has preserved four lines in the life of Terence, in praise of the elegance and purity of that poet’s style. He composed in the Greek language, and in the style and manner of Isocrates, a Commentary or Memoirs of the</p>",
  "page-135": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Transactions of his Consulship. This he sent to Atticus, with a desire, if he approved it, to publish it in Athens and the cities of Greece. He sent a copy of it likewise to Posidonius of Rhodes, and requested of him to undertake the same subject in a more elegant and masterly manner. But the latter returned for answer, that, instead of being encouraged to write by the perusal of his tract, he was quite deterred from attempting it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Upon the plan of those Memoirs, he afterwards composed a Latin poem in three books, in which he carried down the history to the end of his exile, but did not publish it for several years, from motives of delicacy. The three books were severally inscribed to the three Muses; but of this work there now remain only a few fragments, scattered in different parts of his other writings. He published, about the same time, a collection of the principal speeches which he had made in his consulship, under the title of his Consular</p>",
  "page-136": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Orations. They consisted originally of twelve; but four are entirely lost, and some of the rest are imperfect. He now published also, in Latin verse, a translation of the Prognostics of Aratus, of which work no more than two or three small fragments now remain. A few years after, he put the last hand to his Dialogues upon the Character and Idea of the perfect Orator. This admirable work remains entire; a monument both of the astonishing industry and transcendent abilities of its author. At his Cuman villa, he next began a Treatise on Politics, or on the best State of a City, and the Duties of a Citizen. He calls it a great and a laborious work, yet worthy of his pains, if he could succeed in it. This likewise was written in the form of a dialogue, in which the speakers were Scipio, Laelius, Philus, Manilius, and other great persons in the former times of the Republic. It was comprised in six books, and survived him for several ages, though it is now unfortunately lost. From</p>",
  "page-137": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the fragments which remain, it appears to have been a masterly production, in which all the important questions in politics and morality were discussed with elegance and accuracy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Amidst all the anxiety for the interests of the Republic, which occupied the thoughts of this celebrated personage, he yet found leisure to write several philosophical tracts, which still subsist, to the gratification of the literary world. He composed a treatise on the Nature of the Gods, in three books, containing a comprehensive view of religion, faith, oaths, ceremonies, etc. In elucidating this important subject, he not only delivers the opinions of all the philosophers who had written anything concerning it, but weighs and compares attentively all the arguments with each other; forming upon the whole such a rational and perfect system of natural religion, as never before was presented to the consideration of mankind,</p>",
  "page-138": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">and approaching nearly to revelation. He now likewise composed in two books, a discourse on Divination, in which he discusses at large all the arguments that may be advanced for and against the actual existence of such a species of knowledge. Like the preceding works, it is written in the form of dialogue, and in which the chief speaker is Laelius. The same period gave birth to his treatise on Old Age, called Cato Major; and to that on Friendship, written also in dialogue, and in which the chief speaker is Laelius. This book, considered merely as an essay, is one of the most entertaining productions of ancient times; but, beheld as a picture drawn from life, exhibiting the real characters and sentiments of men of the first distinction for virtue and wisdom in the Roman Republic, it becomes doubly interesting to every reader of observation and taste. Cicero now also wrote his discourse on Fate, which was the subject of a conversation with Hirtius, in his villa near Puteoli; and</p>",
  "page-139": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he executed about the same time a translation of Plato’s celebrated Dialogue, called Timaeus, on the nature and origin of the universe. He was employing himself also on a history of his own times, or rather of his own conduct; full of free and severe reflections on those who had abused their power to the oppression of the Republic. Dion Cassius says, that he delivered this book sealed up to his son, with strict orders not to read or publish it till after his death; but from this time he never saw his son, and it is probable that he left the work unfinished. Afterwards, however, some copies of it were circulated; from which his commentator, Asconius, has quoted several particulars.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">During a voyage which he undertook to Sicily, he wrote his treatise on Topics, or the Art of finding Arguments on any Question. This was an abstract from Aristotle’s treatise on the same subject; and though he had neither Aristotle nor any other book to assist him,</p>",
  "page-140": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he drew it up from his memory, and finished it as he sailed along the coast of Calabria. The last  work composed by Cicero appears to have been his Offices, written for the use of his son, to whom it is addressed.

Born in an age posterior to Socrates and Plato, he could not anticipate the principles inculcated by those divine philosophers, but he is justly entitled to the praise, not only of having prosecuted with unerring judgment the steps which they trod before him, but of carrying his researches to</p>",
  "page-141": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">greater extent into the most difficult regions of philosophy. This too he had the merit to perform, neither in the station of a private citizen, nor in the leisure of academic retirement, but in the bustle of public life, amidst the almost constant exertions of the bar, the employment of the magistrate, the duty of the senator, and the incessant cares of the statesman; through a period likewise chequered with domestic afflictions and fatal commotions in the Republic. As a philosopher, his mind appears to have been clear, capacious, penetrating, and insatiable of knowledge. As a writer, he was endowed with every talent that could captivate either the judgment or taste. His researches were continually employed on subjects of the greatest utility to mankind, and those often such as extended beyond the narrow bounds of temporal existence.

  "page-143": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">converse together on important subjects, for mutual information. In treating of any subject respecting which the different sects of philosophers differed  from each other in point of sentiment, no kind of composition could be more happily suited than dialogue, as it gave alternately full scope to the arguments of the various disputants. It required, however, that the writer should exert his understanding with equal impartiality and acuteness on the different sides of the question; as otherwise he might betray a cause under the appearance of defending it. In all the dialogues of Cicero, he manages the arguments of the several disputants in a manner not only the most fair and interesting, but also such as leads to the most probable and rational conclusion.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After enumerating the various tracts composed and published by Cicero, we have now to mention his Letters, which, though not written for publication,</p>",
  "page-144": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">deserve to be ranked among the most interesting remains of Roman literature. The number of such as are addressed to different correspondents is considerable, but those to Atticus alone, his confidential friend, amount to upwards of four hundred; among which are many of great length. They are all written in the genuine spirit of the most approved epistolary composition; uniting familiarity with elevation, and ease with elegance. They display in a beautiful light the author’s character in the social relations of life; as a warm friend, a zealous patron, a tender husband, an affectionate brother, an indulgent father, and a kind master. Beholding them in a more extensive view, they exhibit an ardent love of liberty and the constitution of his country: they discover a mind strongly actuated with the principles of virtue and reason; and while they abound in sentiments the most judicious and philosophical, they are occasionally</p>",
  "page-145": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">blended with the charms of wit, and agreeable effusions of pleasantry. What is likewise no small addition to their merit, they contain much interesting description of private life, with a variety of information relative to public transactions and characters of that age. It appears from Cicero’s correspondence, that there was at that time such a number of illustrious Romans, as never before existed in any one period of the Republic. If ever, therefore, the authority of men the most respectable for virtue, rank, and abilities, could have availed to overawe the first attempts at a violation of public liberty, it must have been at this period; for the dignity of the Roman senate was now in the zenith of its splendour.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Cicero has been accused of excessive vanity, and of arrogating to himself an invidious superiority, from his extraordinary talents but whoever peruses his letters to Atticus, must readily acknowledge, that this imputation appears to be destitute of truth. In those excellent</p>",
  "page-146": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">productions, though he adduces the strongest arguments for and against any object of consideration, that the  most penetrating understanding can suggest, weighs them with each other, and draws from them the most rational conclusions, he yet discovers such a diffidence in his own opinion, that he resigns himself implicitly to the judgment and direction of his friend; a modesty not very compatible with the disposition of the arrogant, who are commonly tenacious of their own opinion, particularly in what relates to any decision of the understanding.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It is difficult to say, whether Cicero appears in his letters more great or amiable: but that he was regarded by his contemporaries in both these lights, and that too in the highest degree, is sufficiently evident. We may thence infer, that the great poets in the subsequent age must have done violence to their own liberality and discernment, when, in compliment to Augustus, whose</p>",
  "page-147": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sensibility would have been wounded by the praises of Cicero, and even by the mention of his name, they have so industriously avoided the subject, as not to afford the most distant intimation that this immortal orator and philosopher had ever existed. Livy however, there is reason to think, did some justice to his memory: but it was not until the race of the Caesars had become extinct, that he received the free and unanimous applause of impartial posterity. Such was the admiration which Quintilian entertained of his writings, that he considered the circumstance or being delighted with them, as an indubitable proof of judgment and taste in literature. Ille se profecisse sciat, cui Cicero valde placebit.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In this period is likewise to be placed M. Terentius Varro, the celebrated Roman grammarian, and the Nestor of ancient learning. The first mention made of him is, that he was lieutenant to Pompey in his piratical</p>",
  "page-148": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">wars, and obtained in that service a naval crown. In the civil wars he joined the side of the Republic, and was taken by Caesar; by whom he was likewise proscribed, but obtained a remission of the sentence. Of all the ancients, he has acquired the greatest fame for his extensive erudition; and we may add, that he displayed the same industry in communicating, as he had done in collecting it. His works originally amounted to no less than five hundred volumes, which have all perished, except a treatise De Lingua Latina, and one De Re Rustica. Of the former of these, which is addressed to Cicero, three books at the beginning are also lost. It appears from the introduction of the fourth book, that they all related to etymology. The first contained such observations as might be made against it; the second, such as might be made in its favour; and the third, observations upon it. He next proceeds to investigate the origin of  Latin words. In the fourth book, he traces</p>",
  "page-149": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">those which relate to place; in the fifth, those connected with the idea of time; and in the sixth, the origin of both these classes, as they appear in the writings of the poets. The seventh book is employed on declension; in which the author enters upon a minute and extensive enquiry, comprehending a variety of acute and profound observations on the formation of Latin nouns, and their respective natural declinations from the nominative case. In the eighth, he examines the nature and limits of usage and analogy in language; and in the ninth and last book on the subject, takes a general view of what is the reverse of analogy, viz. anomaly. The precision and perspicuity which Varro displays in this work merit the highest encomiums, and justify the character given him in his own time, of being the most learned of the Latin grammarians. To the loss of the first three books, are to be added several chasms in the others; but fortunately they happen in such places as</p>",
  "page-150": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">not to affect the coherency of the author’s doctrine, though they interrupt the illustration of it. It is observable that this great grammarian makes use of quom for quum, heis for his, and generally queis for quibus. This practice having become rather obsolete at the time in which he wrote, we must impute his continuance of it to his opinion of its propriety, upon its established principles of grammar, and not to any prejudice of education, or an affectation of singularity. As Varro makes no mention of Caesar’s treatise on Analogy, and had commenced author long before him, it is probable that Caesar’s production was of a much later date; and thence we may infer, that those two writers differed from each other, at least with respect to some particulars on that subject.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This author’s treatise De Re Rustica was undertaken at the desire of a friend, who, having purchased some lands, requested of Varro the favour of his instructions</p>",
  "page-151": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">relative to farming, and the economy of a country life, in its various departments. Though Varro was at this time in his eightieth year, he writes with all the vivacity, though without the levity, of youth, and sets out with invoking, not the Muses, like Homer and Ennius, as he observes, but the twelve deities supposed to be chiefly concerned in the operations of agriculture. It appears from the account which he gives, that upwards of fifty Greek authors had treated of this subject in prose, besides Hesiod and Menecrates the Ephesian, who both wrote in verse; exclusive likewise of many Roman writers, and of Mago the Carthaginian, who wrote in the Punic language. Varro’s work is divided into three books, the first of which treats of agriculture; the second, of rearing of cattle; and the third, of feeding animals for the use of the table.  In the last of these, we meet with a remarkable instance of the prevalence of habit and fashion over human sentiment, where the</p>",
  "page-152": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">author delivers instructions relative to the best method of fattening rats.</p><p>We find from Quintilian, that Varro likewise composed satires in various kinds of verse. It is impossible to behold the numerous fragments of this venerable author without feeling the strongest regret for the loss of that vast collection of information which he had compiled, and of judicious observations which he had made on a variety of subjects, during a life of eighty-eight years, almost entirely devoted to literature. The remark of St. Augustine is well founded, That it is astonishing how Varro, who read such a number of books, could find time to compose so many volumes; and how he who composed so many volumes, could be at leisure to peruse such a variety of books, and to gain so much literary information.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Catullus is said to have been born at Verona, of respectable parents; his father and himself being in the</p>",
  "page-153": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">habit of intimacy with Julius Caesar. He was brought to Rome by Mallius, to whom several of his epigrams are addressed. The gentleness of his manners, and his application to study, we are told, recommended him to general esteem; and he had the good fortune to obtain the patronage of Cicero. When he came to be known as a poet, all these circumstances would naturally contribute to increase his reputation for ingenuity; and accordingly we find his genius applauded by several of his contemporaries. It appears that his works are not transmitted entire to posterity; but there remain sufficient specimens by which we may be enabled to appreciate his poetical talents.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Quintilian, and Diomed the grammarian, have ranked Catullus amongst the iambic writers, while others have placed him amongst the lyric. He has properly a claim to each of these stations; but his versification being chiefly iambic, the former of the</p>",
  "page-154": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">arrangements seems to be the most suitable. The principal merit of Catullus’s Iambics consists in a simplicity of thought and expression. The thoughts, however, are often frivolous, and, what is yet more reprehensible, the author gives way to gross obscenity: in vindication of which, he produces the following couplet, declaring that a good poet ought to be chaste in his own person, but that his verses need not be so.</p><p>Nam castum esse decet pium poetam\nIpsum: versiculos nihil necesse est.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This sentiment has been frequently cited by those who were inclined to follow the example of Catullus; but if such a practice be in any case admissible, it is only where the poet personates  a profligate character; and the instances in which it is adopted by Catullus are not of that description. It had perhaps been a better apology, to have pleaded the manners of the times; for even Horace, who wrote only a few years after, has</p>",
  "page-155": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">suffered his compositions to be occasionally debased by the same kind of blemish.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Much has been said of this poet’s invective against Caesar, which produced no other effect than an invitation to sup at the dictator’s house. It was indeed scarcely entitled to the honour of the smallest resentment. If any could be shewn, it must have been for the freedom used by the author, and not for any novelty in his lampoon. There are two poems on this subject, viz. the twenty-ninth and fifty-seventh, in each of which Caesar is joined with Mamurra, a Roman knight, who had acquired great riches in the Gallic war. For the honour of Catullus’s gratitude, we should suppose that the latter is the one to which historians allude: but, as poetical compositions, they are equally unworthy of regard. The fifty seventh is nothing more than a broad repetition of the raillery, whether well or ill founded, with which Caesar was attacked on various</p>",
  "page-156": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">occasions, and even in the senate, after his return from Bithynia. Caesar had been taunted with this subject for upwards of thirty years; and after so long a familiarity with reproach, his sensibility to the scandalous imputation must now have been much diminished, if not entirely extinguished. The other poem is partly in the same strain, but extended to greater length, by a mixture of common jocular ribaldry of the Roman soldiers, expressed nearly in the same terms which Caesar’s legions, though strongly attached to his person, scrupled not to sport publicly in the streets of Rome, against their general, during the celebration of his triumph. In a word, it deserves to be regarded as an effusion of Saturnalian licentiousness, rather than of poetry. With respect to the Iambics of Catullus, we may observe in general, that the sarcasm is indebted for its force, not so much to ingenuity of sentiment, as to the indelicate nature of the subject, or coarseness of</p>",
  "page-157": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">expression.</p><p>The descriptive poems of Catullus are superior to the others, and discover a lively imagination. Amongst the best of his productions, is a translation of the celebrated ode of Sappho:</p><p>Ille mi par esse Deo videtur,\nme, etc.</p><p>This ode is executed both with spirit and elegance; it is, however, imperfect; and the last stanza seems to be spurious. Catullus’s epigrams are entitled to little praise, with regard either to sentiment or point; and on the whole, his merit, as a poet, appears to have been magnified beyond its real extent. He is said to have died about the thirtieth year of his age.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucretius is the author of a celebrated poem, in six books, De Rerum Natura; a subject which had been treated many ages before by Empedocles, a philosopher and poet of Agrigentum. Lucretius was a zealous partizan of Democritus, and the sect of Epicurus,</p>",
  "page-158": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">whose principles concerning the eternity of matter, the materiality of the soul, and the non-existence of a future state of rewards and punishments, he affects to maintain with a certainty equal to that of mathematical demonstration. Strongly prepossessed with the hypothetical doctrines of his master, and ignorant of the physical system of the universe, he endeavours to deduce from the phenomena of the material world conclusions not only unsupported by legitimate theory, but repugnant to the principles of the highest authority in metaphysical disquisition. But while we condemn his speculative notions as degrading to human nature, and subversive of the most important interests of mankind, we must admit that he has prosecuted his visionary hypothesis with uncommon ingenuity. Abstracting from it the rhapsodical nature of this production, and its obscurity in some parts, it has great merit as a poem. The style is elevated, and the versification in general</p>",
  "page-159": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">harmonious. By the mixture of obsolete words, it possesses an air of solemnity well adapted to abstruse researches; at the same time that by the frequent resolution of diphthongs, it instils into the Latin the sonorous and melodious powers of the Greek language.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">While Lucretius was engaged in this work, he fell into a state of insanity, occasioned, as is supposed, by a philtre, or love-potion, given him by his wife Lucilia. The complaint, however, having lucid intervals, he employed them in the execution of his plan, and, soon after it was finished, laid violent hands upon himself, in the forty-third year of his age. This fatal termination of his life, which perhaps proceeded from insanity, was ascribed by his friends and admirers to his concern for the banishment of one Memmius, with whom he was intimately connected, and for the distracted state of the republic. It was, however, a catastrophe which the principles of Epicurus, equally erroneous and</p>",
  "page-160": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">irreconcilable to resignation and fortitude, authorized in particular circumstances. Even Atticus, the celebrated correspondent of Cicero, a few years after this period, had recourse to the same desperate expedient, by refusing all sustenance, while he laboured under a lingering disease.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It is said that Cicero revised the poem of Lucretius after the death of the author, and this circumstance is urged by the abettors of atheism, as a proof that the principles contained in the work had the sanction of his authority. But no inference in favour of Lucretius’s doctrine can justly be drawn from this circumstance.  Cicero, though already sufficiently acquainted with the principles of the Epicurean sect, might not be averse to the perusal of a production, which collected and enforced them in a nervous strain of poetry; especially as the work was likely to prove interesting to his friend Atticus, and would perhaps afford subject for some</p>",
  "page-161": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">letters or conversation between them. It can have been only with reference to composition that the poem was submitted to Cicero’s revisal: for had he been required to exercise his judgment upon its principles, he must undoubtedly have so much mutilated the work, as to destroy the coherency of the system. He might be gratified with the shew of elaborate research, and confident declamation, which it exhibited, but he must have utterly disapproved of the conclusions which the author endeavoured to establish. According to the best information, Lucretius died in the year from the building of Rome 701, when Pompey was the third time consul. Cicero lived several years beyond this period, and in the two last years of his life, he composed those valuable works which contain sentiments diametrically repugnant to the visionary system of Epicurus. The argument, therefore, drawn from Cicero’s revisal, so far from confirming the principle of</p>",
  "page-162": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Lucretius, affords the strongest tacit declaration against their validity; because a period sufficient for mature consideration had elapsed, before Cicero published his own admirable system of philosophy. The poem of Lucretius, nevertheless, has been regarded as the bulwark of atheism—of atheism, which, while it impiously arrogates the support of reason, both reason and nature disclaim.</p><p>Many more writers flourished in this period, but their works have totally perished.

And Now, Intoxicated With Success, He Sent The Head Of Brutus  To Be Cast At The Foot Of Caesar’s Statue, And Treated The Most Illustrious Of The Prisoners Not Only With Cruelty, But With Abusive Language; Insomuch That He Is Said To Have Answered One Of Them Who Humbly Intreated That At Least He Might Not Remain Unburied, “That Will Be In The Power Of The Birds.” Two Others, Father And Son, Who Begged For Their Lives, He Ordered To Cast Lots Which Of Them Should Live, Or Settle It Between Themselves By The Sword; And Was A Spectator Of Both Their Deaths: For The Father Offering His Life To Save His Son, And Being Accordingly Executed, The Son Likewise Killed Himself Upon The Spot. On This Account, The Rest Of The Prisoners, And Amongst Them Marcus Favonius, Cato’s Rival, Being Led Up In Fetters, After They Had Saluted Antony, The General, With Much Respect, Reviled Octavius In The Foulest Language. After This Victory, Dividing Between Them The Offices Of The State, Mark Antony  Undertook To Restore Order In The East, While Caesar Conducted The Veteran Soldiers Back To Italy, And Settled Them In Colonies On The Lands Belonging To The Municipalities.

For A Common Soldier Having Got Into The Seats Of The Equestrian Order In The Theatre, At The Public Spectacles, Caesar Ordered Him To Be Removed By An Officer; And A Rumour Being Thence Spread By His Enemies, That He Had  Put The Man To Death By Torture, The Soldiers Flocked Together So Much Enraged, That He Narrowly Escaped With His Life. The Only Thing That Saved Him, Was The Sudden Appearance Of The Man, Safe And Sound, No Violence Having Been Offered Him.

Nay, There Are Some Who Relate, That He Entered Upon The War With No Other View, Than That His Secret Enemies, And Those Whom Fear More Than Affection Kept Quiet, Might Be Detected, By Declaring Themselves, Now They Had An Opportunity, With Lucius Antony At Their Head; And That Having Defeated Them, And Confiscated Their Estates, He Might Be Enabled To Fulfil His Promises To The Veteran Soldiers.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

But At Last, Having Built A New Fleet, And Obtained Twenty Thousand Manumitted Slaves , Who Were Given Him For The Oar, He Formed The Julian Harbour At Baiae, By Letting The Sea Into The Lucrine And Avernian Lakes; And Having Exercised His Forces There During The Whole Winter, He Defeated Pompey Betwixt Mylae And Naulochus; Although  Just As The Engagement Commenced, He Suddenly Fell Into Such A Profound Sleep, That His Friends Were Obliged To Wake Him To Give The Signal. This, I Suppose, Gave Occasion For Antony’s Reproach: “You Were Not Able To Take A Clear View Of The Fleet, When Drawn Up In Line Of Battle, But Lay Stupidly Upon Your Back, Gazing At The Sky; Nor Did You Get Up And Let Your Men See You, Until Marcus Agrippa Had Forced The Enemies’ Ships To Sheer Off.” Others Imputed To Him Both A Saying And An Action Which Were Indefensible; For, Upon The Loss Of His Fleets By Storm, He Is Reported To Have Said: “I Will Conquer In Spite Of Neptune;” And At The Next Circensian Games, He Would Not Suffer The Statue Of That God To Be Carried In Procession As Usual. Indeed He Scarcely Ever Ran More Or Greater Risks In Any Of His Wars Than In This. Having Transported Part Of His Army To Sicily, And Being On His Return For The Rest, He Was Unexpectedly Attacked By Demochares And Apollophanes, Pompey’s Admirals, From Whom He Escaped With Great Difficulty, And With One Ship Only.

On This Occasion, As He Was Making His Escape By Some Bye-ways, A Slave Belonging To Aemilius Paulus, Who Accompanied Him, Owing Him A Grudge For The Proscription Of Paulus, The Father Of Aemilius, And Thinking He Had Now An Opportunity Of Revenging It, Attempted To Assassinate Him. After The Defeat Of Pompey, One Of His Colleagues , Marcus Lepidus, Whom He Had Summoned To His Aid From Africa, Affecting Great Superiority, Because He Was At The Head Of Twenty Legions, And Claiming For Himself The Principal Management Of Affairs In A Threatening Manner, He Divested Him Of His Command, But, Upon His Humble Submission, Granted Him His Life, But Banished Him For Life To Circeii.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Yet Upon His Being Declared An Enemy, He Sent To Him All His Relations And Friends, Among Whom Were Caius Sosius And Titus Domitius, At That Time Consuls. He Likewise Spoke Favourably In Public Of The People Of Bologna, For Joining In The Association With The Rest Of Italy To Support His Cause, Because They Had, In Former Times, Been Under The Protection Of The Family Of The Antonii. And Not Long Afterwards He Defeated Him In A Naval Engagement Near Actium, Which Was Prolonged To So Late An Hour, That, After The Victory, He Was Obliged To Sleep On Board His Ship.

In His Passage Thither, He Encountered Two Violent Storms, The First Between The Promontories Of Peloponnesus And Aetolia, And The Other About The Ceraunian Mountains; In Both Which A Part Of His Liburnian Squadron Was Sunk, The Spars And Rigging Of His Own Ship Carried Away, And The Rudder Broken In Pieces. He Remained Only Twenty-seven Days At Brundisium, Until The Demands Of The Soldiers Were Settled, And Then Went, By Way Of Asia And Syria, To Egypt, Where Laying Siege To Alexandria, Whither Antony Had Fled With Cleopatra, He Made Himself Master Of It In A Short Time. He Drove Antony To Kill Himself, After He Had Used Every Effort To Obtain Conditions Of Peace, And He Saw His Corpse . Cleopatra He Anxiously Wished To Save For His Triumph; And When She Was Supposed To Have Been Bit To Death By An Asp, He Sent For The Psylli  To  Endeavour To Suck Out The Poison. He Allowed Them To Be Buried Together In The Same Grave, And Ordered A Mausoleum, Begun By Themselves, To Be Completed. The Eldest Of Antony’s Two Sons By Fulvia He Commanded To Be Taken By Force From The Statue Of Julius Caesar, To Which He Had Fled, After Many Fruitless Supplications For His Life, And Put Him To Death.

Other Nations Also, Which Broke Into Revolt, He Reduced To Submission.

His Own Account Of The Matter, However, Is, That Quintus Gallius Sought A Private Conference With Him, For The Purpose Of Assassinating Him; That He Therefore Put Him In Prison, But Afterwards Released Him, And Banished Him The City; When He Perished Either In A Storm At Sea, Or By Falling Into The Hands Of Robbers.</h4>",

Several Associations Were Formed Under The Specious  Name Of A New College, Which Banded Together For The Perpetration Of All Kinds Of Villany. The Banditti He Quelled By Establishing Posts Of Soldiers In Suitable Stations For The Purpose; The Houses Of Correction Were Subjected To A Strict Superintendence; All Associations, Those Only Excepted Which Were Of Ancient Standing, And Recognised By The Laws, Were Dissolved. He Burnt All The Notes Of Those Who Had Been A Long Time In Arrear With The Treasury, As Being The Principal Source Of Vexatious Suits And Prosecutions. Places In The City Claimed By The Public, Where The Right Was Doubtful, He Adjudged To The Actual Possessors. He Struck Out Of The List Of Criminals The Names Of Those Over Whom Prosecutions Had Been Long Impending, Where Nothing Further Was Intended By The Informers Than To Gratify Their Own Malice, By Seeing Their Enemies Humiliated; Laying It Down As A Rule, That If Any One Chose To Renew A Prosecution, He Should Incur The Risk Of The Punishment Which He Sought To Inflict. And That Crimes Might Not Escape Punishment, Nor Business Be Neglected By Delay, He Ordered The Courts To Sit During The Thirty Days Which Were Spent In Celebrating Honorary Games. To The Three Classes Of Judges Then Existing, He Added A Fourth, Consisting Of Persons Of Inferior Order, Who Were Called Ducenarii, And Decided All Litigations About Trifling Sums. He Chose Judges From The Age Of Thirty Years And Upwards; That Is Five Years Younger Than Had Been Usual Before.

To Save A Culprit, Who Evidently Appeared Guilty Of Parricide, From The Extreme Penalty Of Being Sewn Up In A Sack, Because None Were Punished In That Manner But Such As Confessed The Fact, He Is Said To Have Interrogated Him Thus: “Surely You Did Not Kill Your Father, Did You?” And When, In A Trial Of A Cause About A Forged Will, All Those Who Had Signed It Were Liable To The Penalty Of The Cornelian Law, He Ordered That His Colleagues On The Tribunal Should Not Only Be Furnished With The Two Tablets By Which They Decided, “Guilty Or Not Guilty,” But With A Third Likewise, Ignoring The Offence Of Those Who Should Appear To Have Given Their Signatures Through Any Deception Or Mistake.

The Equestrian Order Clamoured Loudly, At A Spectacle In The Theatre, For Its Total Repeal; Whereupon He Sent For The Children Of Germanicus, And Shewed Them Partly Sitting Upon His Own Lap, And Partly On Their Father’s; Intimating By His Looks And Gestures, That They Ought Not To Think It A Grievance To Follow The Example Of That Young Man.

When They Entered The Military Service, He Not Only Gave Them The Rank Of Military Tribunes In The Legions, But Likewise The Command Of The Auxiliary Horse.

The Mildest Mode Of Reproof Was By Delivering Them Tablets , The Contents Of Which, Confined To Themselves, They Were To Read On The Spot.

In The Election Of Tribunes Of The People, If There Was Not A Sufficient Number Of Senatorian Candidates, He Nominated Others From The Equestrian Order; Granting Them The Liberty, After The Expiration Of Their Office, To Continue In Whichsoever Of The Two Orders They Pleased. As Most Of The Knights Had Been Much Reduced In Their Estates By The Civil Wars, And Therefore Durst Not Sit To See The Public Games In The Theatre In The Seats Allotted To Their Order, For Fear Of The Penalty Provided By The Law In That Case, He Enacted, That None Were Liable To It, Who Had Themselves, Or Whose Parents Had Ever, Possessed A Knight’s Estate. He Took The Census Of The Roman People Street By Street: And That The People Might Not Be Too Often Taken From Their Business To Receive The Distribution Of Corn, It Was His Intention To Deliver Tickets Three Times A Year For Four Months Respectively; But At Their Request, He Continued The Former Regulation, That They Should Receive Their  Share Monthly. He Revived The Former Law Of Elections, Endeavouring, By Various Penalties, To Suppress The Practice Of Bribery. Upon The Day Of Election, He Distributed To The Freemen Of The Fabian And Scaptian Tribes, In Which He Himself Was Enrolled, A Thousand Sesterces Each, That They Might Look For Nothing From Any Of The Candidates. Considering It Of Extreme Importance To Preserve The Roman People Pure, And Untainted With A Mixture Of Foreign Or Servile Blood, He Not Only Bestowed The Freedom Of The City With A Sparing Hand, But Laid Some Restriction Upon The Practice Of Manumitting Slaves. When Tiberius Interceded With Him For The Freedom Of Rome In Behalf Of A Greek Client Of His, He Wrote To Him For Answer, “I Shall Not Grant It, Unless He Comes Himself, And Satisfies Me That He Has Just Grounds For The Application.” And When Livia Begged The Freedom Of The City For A Tributary Gaul, He Refused It, But Offered To Release Him From Payment Of Taxes, Saying, “I Shall Sooner Suffer Some Loss In My Exchequer, Than That The Citizenship Of Rome Be Rendered Too Common.” Not Content With Interposing Many Obstacles To Either The Partial Or Complete Emancipation Of Slaves, By Quibbles Respecting The Number, Condition And Difference Of Those Who Were To Be Manumitted; He Likewise Enacted That None Who Had Been Put In Chains Or Tortured, Should Ever Obtain The Freedom Of The City In Any Degree.

He displayed his munificence to all ranks of the people on various occasions. Moreover, upon his bringing the treasure belonging to the kings of Egypt into the city, in his Alexandrian triumph, he made money so plentiful, that interest fell, and the price of land rose considerably. And afterwards, as often as large sums of money came into his possession by means of</p>",
  "page-213": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">confiscations, he would lend it free of interest, for a fixed term, to such as could give security for the double of what was borrowed. The estate necessary to qualify a senator, instead of eight hundred thousand sesterces, the former standard, he ordered, for the future, to be twelve hundred thousand; and to those who had not so much, he made good the deficiency. He often made donations to the people, but generally of different sums; sometimes four hundred, sometimes three hundred, or two hundred and fifty sesterces upon which occasions, he extended his bounty even to young boys, who before were not used to receive anything, until they arrived at eleven years of age. In a scarcity of corn, he would frequently let them have it at a very low price, or none at all; and doubled the number of the money tickets.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

But To Show That He Was A Prince Who Regarded More The Good Of His People Than Their Applause, He Reprimanded Them Very Severely, Upon Their Complaining Of The Scarcity And Dearness Of Wine. “My Son-in-law, Agrippa,” He Said, “Has Sufficiently Provided For Quenching Your Thirst, By The Great Plenty Of Water With Which He Has Supplied The Town.” Upon Their Demanding A Gift Which He Had Promised Them, He Said, “I Am A Man Of My Word.” But Upon Their Importuning Him For One Which He Had Not Promised, He Issued A Proclamation Upbraiding Them For Their Scandalous Impudence; At The Same Time Telling Them, “I Shall Now Give You Nothing, Whatever I May Have Intended To Do.” With The Same Strict Firmness, When, Upon A Promise He Had Made Of A Donative, He Found Many Slaves Had Been Emancipated And Enrolled Amongst The Citizens, He Declared That No One Should Receive Anything Who Was Not Included In The Promise, And He Gave The Rest Less Than He Had Promised Them, In Order That The Amount He Had Set Apart Might Hold Out. On One Occasion, In A Season Of Great Scarcity, Which It Was Difficult To Remedy, He Ordered Out Of The City The Troops Of Slaves Brought For Sale, The Gladiators  Belonging To The Masters Of Defence, And All Foreigners, Excepting Physicians And The Teachers Of The Liberal Sciences. Part Of The Domestic Slaves Were Likewise Ordered To Be Dismissed. When, At Last, Plenty Was Restored, He Writes Thus “I Was Much Inclined To Abolish For Ever The Practice Of Allowing The People Corn At The Public Expense, Because They Trust So Much To It, That They Are Too Lazy To Till Their Lands; But I Did Not Persevere In My Design, As I Felt Sure That The Practice Would Some Time Or Other Be Revived By Some One Ambitious Of Popular Favour.” However, He So Managed The Affair Ever Afterwards, That As Much Account Was Taken Of Husbandmen And Traders, As Of The Idle Populace.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

The Performances Took Place Sometimes In The Different Streets Of The City, And Upon Several Stages, By Players In All Languages. The Same He Did Not Only In The Forum And Amphitheatre, But In The Circus Likewise, And In The Septa : And Sometimes He Exhibited Only The Hunting Of Wild Beasts. He Entertained The People With Wrestlers In The Campus Martius, Where Wooden Seats Were Erected For The Purpose; And Also With A Naval Fight, For Which He Excavated The Ground Near The Tiber, Where There Is Now The Grove Of The Caesars. During These Two Entertainments He Stationed Guards In The City, Lest, By Robbers Taking Advantage Of The Small Number Of People Left At Home, It Might Be Exposed To Depredations. In The Circus He Exhibited Chariot And Foot Races, And Combats With Wild Beasts, In Which The Performers Were Often Youths Of The Highest Rank. His Favourite Spectacle Was The Trojan Game, Acted By A Select Number Of Boys, In Parties Differing In Age And Station; Thinking  That It Was A Practice Both Excellent In Itself, And Sanctioned By Ancient Usage, That The Spirit Of The Young Nobles Should Be Displayed In Such Exercises. Caius Nonius Asprenas, Who Was Lamed By A Fall In This Diversion, He Presented With A Gold Collar, And Allowed Him And His Posterity To Bear The Surname Of Torquati. But Soon Afterwards He Gave Up The Exhibition Of This Game, In Consequence Of A Severe And Bitter Speech Made In The Senate By Asinius Pollio, The Orator, In Which He Complained Bitterly Of The Misfortune Of Aeserninus, His Grandson, Who Likewise Broke His Leg In The Same Diversion.</h4>",

In one of his public spectacles, he brought the hostages of the Parthians, the first ever sent to Rome from that nation, through the middle of the amphitheatre, and placed them in the second tier of seats above him.

It happened in the Circensian games, which he performed in consequence of a vow, that he was taken ill, and obliged to attend the Thensae , reclining on a litter. Another time, in the games celebrated for the opening of the theatre of Marcellus, the joints of his curule chair happening to give way, he fell on his back. And in the games exhibited by his  grandsons, when the people were in such consternation, by an alarm raised that the theatre was falling, that all his efforts to re-assure them and keep them quiet, failed, he moved from his place, and seated himself in that part of the theatre which was thought to be exposed to most danger.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

He Therefore Procured A Decree Of The Senate, That In All Public Spectacles Of Any Sort, And In Any Place Whatever, The First Tier Of Benches Should Be Left Empty For The Accommodation Of Senators. He Would Not Even Permit The Ambassadors Of Free Nations, Nor Of Those Which Were Allies Of Rome, To Sit In The Orchestra; Having Found That Some Manumitted Slaves Had Been Sent Under That Character.

When Present, He Never Attended To Anything Else Either To Avoid The Reflections Which He Used To Say Were Commonly Made Upon His Father, Caesar, For Perusing Letters And Memorials, And Making Rescripts During The Spectacles; Or From The Real Pleasure He Took In Attending Those Exhibitions; Of Which He Made No Secret, He Often Candidly Owning It. This He Manifested Frequently By Presenting Honorary Crowns And Handsome Rewards To The Best Performers, In The Games Exhibited By Others; And He Never Was Present At Any Performance Of The Greeks, Without Rewarding The Most Deserving, According To Their Merit. He Took Particular Pleasure In Witnessing Pugilistic Contests, Especially Those Of The Latins, Not Only Between Combatants Who Had Been Trained Scientifically, Whom He Used Often To Match With The Greek Champions; But Even Between Mobs Of The Lower Classes Fighting In Streets, And Tilting At Random, Without Any Knowledge Of The Art. In Short, He Honoured With His Patronage All Sorts Of People Who Contributed In Any Way To The Success Of The Public Entertainments. He Not Only Maintained, But Enlarged, The Privileges Of The Wrestlers. He Prohibited Combats Of Gladiators Where No Quarter Was Given. He Deprived The Magistrates Of The Power Of Correcting The Stage-players, Which By An Ancient Law Was Allowed Them At All Times, And In All Places; Restricting Their Jurisdiction Entirely To The Time Of Performance And Misdemeanours In The Theatres. He Would, However, Admit, Of No Abatement, And Exacted With The Utmost Rigour The Greatest Exertions Of The Wrestlers And Gladiators In Their Several Encounters. He Went So Far In Restraining The Licentiousness Of Stage-players, That Upon Discovering That Stephanio, A Performer Of The Highest Class, Had A Married Woman With Her Hair Cropped, And Dressed In Boy’s Clothes, To Wait Upon Him At Table, He Ordered Him To Be Whipped Through All The Three Theatres, And Then Banished Him. Hylas, An Actor Of Pantomimes, Upon A Complaint Against Him By The Praetor, He Commanded To Be Scourged In The Court Of His Own House, Which, However, Was Open To The Public.

His Countenance, Either When Discoursing Or Silent, Was So Calm And Serene, That A  Gaul Of The First Rank Declared Amongst His Friends, That He Was So Softened By It, As To Be Restrained From Throwing Him Down A Precipice, In His Passage Over The Alps, When He Had Been Admitted To Approach Him, Under Pretence Of Conferring With Him. His Eyes Were Bright And Piercing; And He Was Willing It Should Be Thought That There Was Something Of A Divine Vigour In Them.

But In His Old Age, He Saw Very Imperfectly With His Left Eye. His Teeth Were Thin Set, Small And Scaly, His Hair A Little Curled, And Inclining To A Yellow Colour. His Eye-brows Met; His Ears Were Small, And He Had An Aquiline Nose. His Complexion Was Betwixt Brown And Fair; His Stature But Low; Though Julius Marathus, His Freedman, Says He Was Five Feet And Nine Inches In Height.

In His Intercourse With Individuals, And Even With His Wife Livia, Upon Subjects Of Importance He Wrote On His Tablets All He Wished To Express, Lest, If He Spoke Extempore, He Should Say More Or Less Than Was Proper.

He Likewise Read Over To  His Friends His “Exhortations To Philosophy,” And The “History Of His Own Life,” Which He Continued In Thirteen Books, As Far As The Cantabrian War, But No Farther. He Likewise Made Some Attempts At Poetry. There Is Extant One Book Written By Him In Hexameter Verse, Of Which Both The Subject And Title Is “Sicily.” There Is Also A Book Of Epigrams, No Larger Than The Last, Which He Composed Almost Entirely While He Was In The Bath.

Those Who Used Affected Language, Or Adopted Obsolete Words, He Despised, As Equally Faulty, Though In Different Ways. He Sometimes Indulged Himself In Jesting, Particularly With His Friend Mecaenas, Whom He Rallied Upon All Occasions For His Fine Phrases , And Bantered By Imitating His Way Of Talking. Nor Did He Spare Tiberius, Who Was Fond Of Obsolete And Far-fetched Expressions. He Charges Mark Antony With Insanity, Writing Rather To Make Men Stare, Than To Be Understood; And By Way Of Sarcasm Upon His Depraved And Fickle Taste In The Choice Of Words, He Writes To Him Thus: “And Are You Yet In Doubt, Whether Cimber Annius Or Veranius Flaccus Be More Proper For Your Imitation? Whether You Will Adopt Words Which Sallustius Crispus Has Borrowed From The ‘Origines’ Of Cato? Or Do You Think That The Verbose Empty Bombast Of Asiatic Orators Is Fit To Be Transfused Into  Our Language?” And In A Letter Where He Commends The Talent Of His Grand-daughter, Agrippina, He Says, “But You Must Be Particularly Careful, Both In Writing And Speaking, To Avoid Affectation.”</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Afterwards, Being Instructed In Philology By Sephaerus, He Received Into His Family Areus The Philosopher, And His Sons Dionysius And Nicanor; But He Never Could Speak The Greek Tongue Readily, Nor Ever Ventured To Compose In It. For If There Was Occasion For Him To Deliver His Sentiments In That Language, He Always Expressed What He Had To Say In Latin, And Gave It Another To Translate. He Was Evidently Not Unacquainted With The Poetry Of The Greeks, And Had A Great Taste For The Ancient Comedy, Which He Often Brought Upon The Stage, In His Public Spectacles. In Reading The Greek And Latin Authors, He Paid Particular Attention To Precepts And Examples Which Might Be Useful In Public Or Private Life. Those He Used To Extract Verbatim, And Gave To His Domestics, Or Send To The Commanders Of The Armies, The Governors Of The Provinces, Or The Magistrates Of The City, When Any Of Them Seemed To Stand In Need Of Admonition.

He Patronised The Men Of Genius Of That Age In Every Possible Way. He Would Hear Them Read Their Works With A Great Deal Of Patience And Good Nature; And Not Only Poetry  And History, But Orations And Dialogues. He Was Displeased, However, That Anything Should Be Written Upon Himself, Except In A Grave Manner, And By Men Of The Most Eminent Abilities: And He Enjoined The Praetors Not To Suffer His Name To Be Made Too Common In The Contests Amongst Orators And Poets In The Theatres.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Had Many Frivolous And Frightful Dreams During The Spring; But In The Other Parts Of The Year, They Were Less Frequent And More Significative. Upon His Frequently Visiting A Temple Near The Capitol, Which He Had Dedicated To Jupiter Tonans, He Dreamt That Jupiter Capitolinus Complained That His Worshippers Were Taken From Him, And That Upon This He Replied, He Had Only Given Him The Thunderer For His Porter . He Therefore Immediately Suspended Little Bells Round The Summit Of The Temple; Because Such Commonly Hung At The Gates Of Great Houses.

The next day, meeting Augustus, with whom till that hour he had not the least acquaintance, and looking at him with admiration, he said he was extremely like the boy he had seen in his dream. Some give a different account of Catulus’s first dream, namely, that Jupiter, upon several noble lads requesting of him that they might have a guardian, had pointed to one amongst them, to whom they were to prefer their requests; and putting his fingers to the boy’s mouth to kiss, he afterwards applied them to his own.</p>",

And immediately upon sight of Augustus, who had been sent for by his uncle Caesar to the sacrifice, and was as yet perfectly unknown to most of the company, he affirmed that it was the very boy he had seen in his dream.

By the long duration of the late civil war, with its concomitant train of public calamities, the minds of men were become less averse to the prospect of an absolute government; at the same time that the new emperor, naturally prudent and politic, had learned from the fate of Julius the art of preserving supreme power, without arrogating to himself any invidious</p>",

He affected to decline public honours, disclaimed every idea of personal superiority, and in all his behaviour displayed a degree of moderation which prognosticated the most happy effects, in restoring peace and prosperity to the harassed empire. The tenor of his future conduct was suitable to this auspicious commencement. While he endeavoured to conciliate the affections of the people by lending money to those who stood in need of it, at low interest, or without any at all, and by the exhibition of public shows, of which the Romans were remarkably fond; he was attentive to the preservation of a becoming dignity in the government, and to the correction of morals. The senate, which, in the time of Sylla, had increased to upwards of four hundred, and, during the civil war, to a thousand, members, by the admission of improper persons, he reduced to six hundred; and being invested with the ancient office of censor, which had for some</p>",
  "page-303": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">time been disused, he exercised an arbitrary but legal authority over the conduct of every rank in the state; by which he could degrade senators and knights, and inflict upon all citizens an ignominious sentence for any immoral or indecent behaviour. But nothing contributed more to render the new form of government acceptable to the people, than the frequent distribution of corn, and sometimes largesses, amongst the commonalty: for an occasional scarcity of provisions had always been the chief cause of discontents and tumults in the capital. To the interests of the army he likewise paid particular attention. It was by the assistance of the legions that he had risen to power; and they were the men who, in the last resort, if such an emergency should ever occur, could alone enable him to preserve it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">History relates, that after the overthrow of Antony, Augustus held a consultation with Agrippa and</p>",
  "page-304": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Mecaenas about restoring the republican form of government; when Agrippa gave his opinion in favour of that measure, and Mecaenas opposed it.  The object of this consultation, in respect to its future consequences on society, is perhaps the most important ever agitated in any cabinet, and required, for the mature discussion of it, the whole collective wisdom of the ablest men in the empire. But this was a resource which could scarcely be adopted, either with security to the public quiet, or with unbiassed judgment in the determination of the question. The bare agitation of such a point would have excited immediate and strong anxiety for its final result; while the friends of a republican government, who were still far more numerous than those of the other party, would have strained every nerve to procure a determination in their own favour; and the pretorian guards, the surest protection of Augustus, finding their situation</p>",
  "page-305": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">rendered precarious by such an unexpected occurrence, would have readily listened to the secret propositions and intrigues of the republicans for securing their acquiescence to the decision on the popular side. If, when the subject came into debate, Augustus should be sincere in the declaration to abide by the resolution of the council, it is beyond all doubt, that the restoration of a republican government would have been voted by a great majority of the assembly. If, on the contrary, he should not be sincere, which is the more probable supposition, and should incur the suspicion of practising secretly with members for a decision according to his wish, he would have rendered himself obnoxious to the public odium, and given rise to discontents which might have endangered his future security.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But to submit this important question to the free and unbiassed decision of a numerous assembly, it is</p>",
  "page-306": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">probable, neither suited the inclination of Augustus, nor perhaps, in his opinion, consisted with his personal safety. With a view to the attainment of unconstitutional power, he had formerly deserted the cause of the republic when its affairs were in a prosperous situation; and now, when his end was accomplished, there could be little ground to expect, that he should voluntarily relinquish the prize for which he had spilt the best blood of Rome, and contended for so many years. Ever since the final defeat of Antony in the battle of Actium, he had governed the Roman state with uncontrolled authority; and though there is in the nature of unlimited power an intoxicating quality, injurious both to public and private virtue, yet all history contradicts the supposition of its being endued with any which is unpalatable to the general taste of mankind.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There were two chief motives by which Augustus</p>",
  "page-307": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">would naturally be influenced in a deliberation on this important subject; namely, the love of power, and the personal danger which  he might incur from relinquishing it. Either of these motives might have been a sufficient inducement for retaining his authority; but when they both concurred, as they seem to have done upon this occasion, their united force was irresistible. The argument, so far as relates to the love of power, rests upon a ground, concerning the solidity of which, little doubt can be entertained: but it may be proper to inquire, in a few words, into the foundation of that personal danger which he dreaded to incur, on returning to the station of a private citizen.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Augustus, as has been already observed, had formerly sided with the party which had attempted to restore public liberty after the death of Julius Caesar: but he afterwards abandoned the popular cause, and joined in the ambitious plans of Antony and Lepidus to</p>",
  "page-308": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">usurp amongst themselves the entire dominion of the state. By this change of conduct, he turned his arms against the supporters of a form of government which he had virtually recognized as the legal constitution of Rome; and it involved a direct implication of treason against the sacred representatives of that government, the consuls, formally and duly elected. Upon such a charge he might be amenable to the capital laws of his country. This, however, was a danger which might be fully obviated, by procuring from the senate and people an act of oblivion, previously to his abdication of the supreme power; and this was a preliminary which doubtless they would have admitted and ratified with unanimous approbation. It therefore appears that he could be exposed to no inevitable danger on this account: but there was another quarter where his person was vulnerable, and where even the laws might not be sufficient to protect him against the efforts of</p>",
  "page-309": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">private resentment. The bloody proscription of the Triumvirate no act of amnesty could ever erase from the minds of those who had been deprived by it of their nearest and dearest relations; and amidst the numerous connections of the illustrious men sacrificed on that horrible occasion, there might arise some desperate avenger, whose indelible resentment nothing less would satisfy than the blood of the surviving delinquent. Though Augustus, therefore, might not, like his great predecessor, be stabbed in the senate-house, he might perish by the sword or the poniard in a less conspicuous situation. After all, there seems to have been little danger from this quarter likewise for Sylla, who in the preceding age had been guilty of equal enormities, was permitted, on relinquishing the place of perpetual dictator, to end his days in quiet retirement; and the undisturbed security which Augustus ever afterwards enjoyed, affords sufficient proof, that all apprehension</p>",
  "page-310": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of danger to his person was merely chimerical.</p><p>We have hitherto considered this grand consultation as it might be influenced by the passions or prejudices of the emperor: we shall now take a short view of the subject in the light in which it is connected with considerations of a political nature, and with public utility. The arguments handed down by history respecting this consultation are few, and imperfectly delivered; but they may be extended upon the general principles maintained on each side of the question.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For the restoration of the republican government, it might be contended, that from the expulsion of the kings to the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, through a period of upwards of four hundred and sixty years, the Roman state, with the exception only of a short interval, had flourished and increased with a degree of prosperity unexampled in the annals of humankind: that the republican form of government was not only</p>",
  "page-311": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">best adapted to the improvement of national grandeur, but to the security of general freedom, the great object of all political association: that public virtue, by which alone nations could subsist in vigour, was cherished and protected by no mode of administration so much as by that which connected, in the strongest bonds of union, the private interests of individuals with those of the community: that the habits and prejudices of the Roman people were unalterably attached to the form of government established by so long a prescription, and they would never submit, for any length of time, to the rule of one person, without making every possible effort to recover their liberty: that though despotism, under a mild and wise prince, might in some respects be regarded as preferable to a constitution which was occasionally exposed to the inconvenience of faction and popular tumults, yet it was a dangerous experiment to abandon the government of the nation to the</p>",
  "page-312": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">contingency of such a variety of characters as usually occurs in the succession of princes; and, upon the whole, that the interests of the people were more safely entrusted in the hands of annual magistrates elected by themselves, than in those of any individual whose power was permanent, and subject to no legal control.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In favour of despotic government it might be urged, that though Rome had subsisted long and gloriously under a republican form of government, yet she had often experienced such violent shocks from popular tumults or the factions of the great, as had threatened her with imminent destruction: that a republican government was only accommodated to a people amongst whom the division of property gave to no class of citizens such a degree of pre-eminence as might prove dangerous to public freedom: that there was required in that form of political constitution, a simplicity  of life and strictness of manners which are never observed to</p>",
  "page-313": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">accompany a high degree of public prosperity: that in respect of all these considerations, such a form of government was utterly incompatible with the present circumstances of the Romans that by the conquest of so many foreign nations, by the lucrative governments of provinces, the spoils of the enemy in war, and the rapine too often practised in time of peace, so great had been the aggrandizement of particular families in the preceding age, that though the form of the ancient constitution should still remain inviolate, the people would no longer live under a free republic, but an aristocratical usurpation, which was always productive of tyranny: that nothing could preserve the commonwealth from becoming a prey to some daring confederacy, but the firm and vigorous administration of one person, invested with the whole executive power of the state, unlimited and uncontrolled: in fine, that as Rome had been nursed to maturity by the government</p>",
  "page-314": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of six princes successively, so it was only by a similar form of political constitution that she could now be saved from aristocratical tyranny on one hand, or, on the other, from absolute anarchy.</p><p>On whichever side of the question the force of argument may be thought to preponderate, there is reason to believe that Augustus was guided in his resolution more by inclination and prejudice than by reason. It is related, however, that hesitating between the opposite opinions of his two counsellors, he had recourse to that of Virgil, who joined with Mecaenas in advising him to retain the imperial power, as being the form of government most suitable to the circumstances of the times.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It is proper in this place to give some account of the two ministers above-mentioned, Agrippa and Mecaenas, who composed the cabinet of Augustus at the settlement of his government, and seem to be the</p>",

Both he and Mecaenas had a delicate sensibility to the beauties of poetical composition; and judging from their own feelings, they attached a high degree of influence to the charms of poetry. Impressed with these sentiments, it became an object of importance, in their opinion, to engage the Muses in the service of the imperial authority; on which account, we find Mecaenas tampering with Propertius, and we may presume, likewise with every other rising genius in poetry, to undertake an heroic poem, of which Augustus should be the hero. As the application to Propertius cannot have taken place until after Augustus had been amply celebrated by the superior abilities of Virgil and Horace, there seems to be some reason for ascribing Mecaenas’s request to a political motive.

As one of them, doubtless, was intended to succeed to the government of the empire, prudence justified the adoption of every expedient that might tend to secure a quiet succession to the heir, upon the demise of Augustus. As a subsidiary resource, therefore, the expedient above mentioned was judged highly plausible; and the Roman cabinet indulged the idea of endeavouring to confirm imperial authority by the support of poetical renown. Lampoons against the government were not uncommon even in the time of Augustus; and elegant panegyric on the emperor served to counteract their influence upon the minds of the people. The idea was, perhaps, novel in the time of Augustus; but the history of later ages affords examples of its having been adopted, under different forms of government, with success.</p>",
  "page-323": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Roman empire, in the time of Augustus, had attained to a prodigious magnitude; and, in his testament, he recommended to his successors never to exceed the limits which he had prescribed to its extent. On the East it stretched to the Euphrates; on the South to the cataracts of the Nile, the deserts of Africa, and Mount Atlas; on the West to the Atlantic Ocean; and on the North to the Danube and the Rhine; including the best part of the then known world. The Romans, therefore, were not improperly called rerum domini , and Rome, pulcherrima rerum , maxima rerum . Even the historians, Livy and Tacitus,  actuated likewise with admiration, bestow magnificent epithets on the capital of their country.

We can only be assured that the revenue must have been immense, which arose from the accumulated contribution of such a number of nations, that had supported their own civil establishments with great splendour, and many of which were celebrated for their extraordinary riches and commerce. The tribute paid by the Romans themselves, towards the support of the government, was very considerable during the latter ages of the republic, and it received an increase after the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa. The establishments,</p>",
  "page-325": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">both civil and military, in the different provinces, were supported at their own expense; the emperor required but a small naval force, an arm which adds much to the public expenditure of maritime nations in modern times; and the state was burdened with no diplomatic charges. The vast treasure accruing from the various taxes centered in Rome, and the whole was at the disposal of the emperor, without any control. We may therefore justly conclude that, in the amount of taxes, customs, and every kind of financial resources, Augustus exceeded all sovereigns who had hitherto ever swayed the sceptre of imperial dominion; a noble acquisition, had it been judiciously employed by his successors, in promoting public happiness, with half the profusion in which it was lavished in disgracing human nature, and violating the rights of mankind.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The reign of Augustus is distinguished by the most extraordinary event recorded in history, either sacred or</p>",

Socrates had laid an admirable foundation for the improvement of human nature, by the exertion of reason through the whole economy of life; but succeeding inquirers, forsaking the</p>",
  "page-327": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">true path of ethic investigation, deviated into specious discussions, rather ingenious than useful; and some of them, by gratuitously adopting principles, which, so far from being supported by reason, were repugnant to its dictates, endeavoured to erect upon the basis of their respective doctrines a system peculiar to themselves. The doctrines of the Stoics and Epicureans were, in fact, pernicious to society; and those of the different academies, though more intimately connected with reason than the two former, were of a nature too abstract to have any immediate or useful influence on life and manners. General discussions of truth and probability, with magnificent declamations on the to kalon, and the summum bonum, constituted the chief objects of attention amongst those who cultivated moral science in the shades of academical retirement. Cicero endeavoured to bring back philosophy from speculation to practice, and clearly evinced the social</p>",

The object of it was not so much justness of sentiment and propriety of expression, as the art of declaiming, or speaking copiously upon any subject. It is mentioned by Varro as the reverse of logic; and they are distinguished from each other by a simile, that the former resembles the palm of the hand expanded, and the latter, contracted into the fist. It is observable that logic, though a part of education in modern times, seems not to have been cultivated amongst the Romans. Perhaps they were apprehensive, lest a science which</p>",

Astronomy was long before known in the eastern nations; but there is reason to believe, from a passage in Virgil , that it was little cultivated by the Romans; and it is certain, that in the reformation of the calendar, Julius Caesar was chiefly indebted to the scientific knowledge of  Sosigenes, a mathematician of Alexandria. The laws of the solar system were still but imperfectly known; the popular belief, that the sun moved round the earth, was universally maintained, and continued until the sixteenth century, when the contrary was proved by Copernicus. There existed many celebrated tracts on mathematics; and several of the mechanical powers, particularly that of the lever, were cultivated with success. The more necessary and useful rules of arithmetic were generally known. The use of the load-stone not being as yet discovered, navigation was</p>",

Geography was cultivated during the present period by Strabo and Mela. In natural philosophy little progress was made; but a strong desire of its improvement was entertained, particularly by Virgil. Human anatomy being not yet introduced, physiology was imperfect. Chemistry, as a science, was utterly unknown. In medicine, the writings of Hippocrates, and other Greek physicians, were in general the standard of practice; but the Materia Medica contained few remedies of approved quality, and abounded with useless substances, as well as with many which stood upon no other foundation than the whimsical notions of those who first introduced them.

A book of his, written in hexameter verse, under the title of Sicily, was extant in the time of Suetonius, as was likewise a book of Epigrams.

This useful kind of narrative was introduced about five hundred years before by Herodotus, who has thence received the appellation of the Father of History. His style, in conformity to the habits of thinking, and the simplicity of language, in an uncultivated age, is plain and unadorned; yet, by the happy modulation of the Ionic dialect, it gratified the ear, and afforded to the states of Greece a pleasing mixture of entertainment, enriched not only with various information, often indeed fabulous or unauthentic, but with the rudiments, indirectly interspersed, of political wisdom. This writer, after a long interval, was succeeded by</p>",
  "page-334": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Thucydides and Xenophon, the former of whom carried historical narrative to the highest degree of improvement it ever attained among the States of Greece. The plan of Thucydides seems to have continued to be the model of historical narrative to the writers of Rome; but the circumstances of the times, aided perhaps by the splendid exertion of genius in other departments of literature, suggested a new resource, which promised not only to animate, but embellish the future productions of the historic Muse. This innovation consisted in an attempt to penetrate the human heart, and explore in its innermost recesses the sentiments and secret motives which actuate the conduct of men. By connecting moral effects with their probable internal and external causes, it tended to establish a systematic consistency in the concatenation of transactions apparently anomalous, accidental, or totally independent of each other.</p>",

Of his industry in collating, and his judgment in deciding upon the preference due to, dissentient authorities, in matters of testimony, the work affords numberless proofs. Of the freedom and impartiality with which he treated even of the recent periods of history, there cannot be more convincing</p>",
  "page-339": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">evidence, than that he was rallied by Augustus as a favourer of Pompey; and that, under the same emperor, he not only bestowed upon Cicero the tribute of warm approbation, but dared to ascribe, in an age when their names were obnoxious, even to Brutus and Cassius the virtues of consistency and patriotism. If in any thing the conduct of Livy violates our sentiments of historical dignity, it is the apparent complacency and reverence with which he every where mentions the popular belief in omens and prodigies; but this was the general superstition of the times; and totally to renounce the prejudices of superstitious education, is the last heroic sacrifice to philosophical scepticism. In general, however, the credulity of Livy appears to be rather affected than real; and his account of the exit of Romulus, in the following passage, may be adduced as an instance in confirmation of this remark.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“His immortalibus editis operibus, quum ad</p>",

There is more implied than the author thought proper to avow, in the sentence, Fuisse credo, etc. In whatever light this anecdote be viewed, it is involved in perplexity. That Romulus affected a despotic power, is not only highly probable, from his aspiring disposition, but seems to be confirmed by his recent appointment of the Celeres, as a guard to his person. He might, therefore, naturally incur the odium of the patricians, whose importance was diminished, and their institution rendered abortive, by the increase of his power. But that they should choose the opportunity of a military review, for the purpose of removing the tyrant by a violent death, seems not very consistent with the dictates even of common prudence; and it is the more incredible, as the circumstance which favoured the execution of the plot is represented to have been entirely a fortuitous</p>",
  "page-343": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">occurrence. The tempest which is said to have happened, is not easily reconcilable with our knowledge of that phenomenon. Such a cloud, or mist, as could have enveloped Romulus from the eyes of the assembly, is not a natural concomitant of a thunder-storm. There is some reason to suspect that both the noise and cloud, if they actually existed, were artificial; the former intended to divert the attention of the spectators, and the latter to conceal the transaction. The word fragor, a noise or crash, appears to be an unnecessary addition where thunder is expressed, though sometimes so used by the poets, and may therefore, perhaps, imply such a noise from some other cause. If Romulus was killed by any pointed or sharp-edged weapon, his blood might have been discovered on the spot; or, if by other means, still the body was equally an object for public observation. If the people suspected the patricians to be guilty of murder, why did they not endeavour to trace</p>",
  "page-344": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the fact by this evidence? And if the patricians were really innocent, why did they not urge the examination? But the body, without doubt, was secreted, to favour the imposture. The whole narrative is strongly marked with circumstances calculated to affect credulity with ideas of national importance; and, to countenance the design, there is evidently a chasm in the Roman history immediately preceding this transaction and intimately connected with it.</p><p>Livy was born at Patavium , and has been charged by Asinius Pollio and others with the provincial dialect of his country.

  "page-345": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">comparison between them, in respect of their principal qualities, as writers. With regard to language, there is less apparent affectation in Livy than in Sallust. The narrative of both is distinguished by an elevation of style: the elevation of Sallust seems to be often supported by the dignity of assumed virtue; that of Livy by a majestic air of historical, and sometimes national, importance. In delineating characters, Sallust infuses more expression, and Livy more fulness, into the features.

The first seven years of his life was spent at Cremona, whence he went to Mediolanum, now Milan, at that time the seat of the liberal arts, denominated, as we learn from Pliny the younger, Novae Athenae. From this place he afterwards moved to Naples, where he applied himself with great assiduity to Greek and Roman literature, particularly to the physical and mathematical sciences; for which he expressed a strong predilection in the second book of his Georgics.</p><p>Me vero primum dulces ante omnia Musae,\nQuarum sacra fero ingenti perculsus amore,\nAccipiant; coelique vias et sidera monstrent;\nDefectus Solis varios, Lunaeque labores:\nUnde tremor terris: qua vi maria alta tumescant\nObicibus ruptis, rursusque in seipsa residant:\nQuid tantum Oceano properent se tingere soles\nHiberni: vel quae tardis mora noctibus obstet.\nGeor. ii. 1. 591, etc.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But most beloved, ye Muses, at whose fane,\nLed by</p>",

It may be</p>",
  "page-349": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">questioned whether any language which has its provincial dialects, but is brought to perfection, can ever be well adapted, in that state, to the use of pastoral poetry. There is such an apparent incongruity between the simple ideas of the rural swain and the polished language of the courtier, that it seems impossible to reconcile them together by the utmost art of composition. The Doric dialect of Theocritus, therefore, abstractedly from all consideration of simplicity of sentiment, must ever give to the Sicilian bard a pre-eminence in this species of poetry. The greater part of the Bucolics of Virgil may be regarded as poems of a peculiar nature, into which the author has happily transfused, in elegant versification, the native manners and ideas, without any mixture of the rusticity of pastoral life. With respect to the fourth eclogue, addressed to Pollio, it is avowedly of a nature superior to that of pastoral subjects:</p>",
  "page-350": "<p>Sicelides Musae, paullo majora canamus.\nSicilian Muse, be ours a loftier strain.</p><p>Virgil engaged in bucolic poetry at the request of Asinius Pollio, whom he highly esteemed, and for one of whose sons in particular,  with Cornelius Gallus, a poet likewise, he entertained the warmest affection. He has celebrated them all in these poems, which were begun, we are told, in the twenty-ninth year of his age, and completed in three years. They were held in so great esteem amongst the Romans, immediately after their publication, that it is said they were frequently recited upon the stage for the entertainment of the audience. Cicero, upon hearing some lines of them, perceived that they were written in no common strain of poetry, and desired that the whole eclogue might be recited: which being done, he exclaimed, “Magnae spes altera Romae.” Another hope of mighty Rome!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Virgil’s next work was the Georgics, the idea of</p>",
  "page-351": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">which is taken from the Erga kai Hmerai, the Works and Days of Hesiod, the poet of Ascra. But between the productions of the two poets, there is no other similarity than that of their common subject. The precepts of Hesiod, in respect of agriculture, are delivered with all the simplicity of an unlettered cultivator of the fields, intermixed with plain moral reflections, natural and apposite; while those of Virgil, equally precise and important, are embellished with all the dignity of sublime versification. The work is addressed to Mecaenas, at whose request it appears to have been undertaken. It is divided into four books. The first treats of ploughing; the second, of planting; the third, of cattle, horses, sheep, goats, dogs, and of things which are hurtful to cattle; the fourth is employed on bees, their proper habitations, food, polity, the diseases to which they are liable, and the remedies of them, with the method of making honey,</p>",
  "page-352": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and a variety of other considerations connected with the subject. The Georgics  were written at Naples, and employed the author during a period of seven years. It is said that Virgil had concluded the Georgics with a laboured eulogium on his poetical friend Gallus; but the latter incurring about this time the displeasure of Augustus, he was induced to cancel it, and substitute the charming episode of Astaeus and Eurydice.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">These beautiful poems, considered merely as didactic, have the justest claim to utility. In what relates to agriculture in particular, the precepts were judiciously adapted to the climate of Italy, and must have conveyed much valuable information to those who were desirous of cultivating that important art, which was held in great honour amongst the Romans. The same remark may be made, with greater latitude of application, in respect of the other subjects. But when we examine the Georgics as poetical compositions,</p>",
  "page-353": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">when we attend to the elevated style in which they are written, the beauty of the similes, the emphatic sentiments interspersed, the elegance of diction, the animated strain of the whole, and the harmony of the versification, our admiration is excited, at beholding subjects, so common in their nature, embellished with the most magnificent decorations of poetry.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">During four days which Augustus passed at Atella, to refresh himself from fatigue, in his return to Rome, after the battle of Actium, the Georgics, just then finished, were read to him by the author, who was occasionally relieved in the task by his friend Mecaenas.

  "page-354": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">subject of heroic renown.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It is generally supposed that the Aeneid was written at the particular desire of Augustus, who was ambitious of having the Julian family represented as lineal descendants of the Trojan Aeneas. In this celebrated poem, Virgil has happily united the characteristics of the Iliad and Odyssey, and blended them so judiciously together, that they mutually contribute to the general effect of the whole. By the esteem and sympathy excited for the filial piety and misfortunes of Aeneas at the catastrophe of Troy, the reader is strongly interested in his subsequent adventures; and every obstacle to the establishment of the Trojans in the promised land of Hesperia produces fresh sensations of increased admiration and attachment. The episodes, characters, and incidents, all concur to give beauty or grandeur to the poem. The picture of Troy in flames can never be sufficiently  admired! The incomparable portrait of</p>",
  "page-355": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Priam, in Homer, is admirably accommodated to a different situation, in the character of Anchises, in the Aeneid. The prophetic rage of the Cumaean Sibyl displays in the strongest colours the enthusiasm of the poet. For sentiment, passion, and interesting description, the episode of Dido is a master-piece in poetry. But Virgil is not more conspicuous for strength of description than propriety of sentiment; and wherever he takes a hint from the Grecian bard, he prosecutes the idea with a judgment peculiar to himself. It may be sufficient to mention one instance. In the sixth book of the Iliad, while the Greeks are making great slaughter amongst the Trojans, Hector, by the advice of Helenus, retires into the city, to desire that his mother would offer up prayers to the goddess Pallas, and vow to her a noble sacrifice, if she would drive Diomede from the walls of Troy. Immediately before his return to the field of battle, he has his last interview</p>",
  "page-356": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">with Andromache, whom he meets with his infant son Astyanax, carried by a nurse. There occurs, upon this occasion, one of the most beautiful scenes in the Iliad, where Hector dandles the boy in his arms, and pours forth a prayer, that he may one day be superior in fame to his father. In the same manner, Aeneas, having armed himself for the decisive combat with Turnus, addresses his son Ascanius in a beautiful speech, which, while expressive of the strongest paternal affection, contains, instead of a prayer, a noble and emphatic admonition, suitable to a youth who had nearly attained the period of adult age. It is as follows:</p><p>Disce, puer, virtutem ex me, verumque laborem;\nFortunam ex aliis; nunc te mea dextera bello\nDefensum dabit, et magna inter praemia ducet.\nTu facito, mox cum matura adoleverit aetas,\nSis memor: et te animo repetentem exempla tuorum,\nEt pater Aeneas, et avunculus excitet Hector.—Aeneid, xii.</p>",
  "page-357": "<p>My son! from my example learn the war\nIn camps to suffer, and in feuds to dare,\nBut happier chance than mine attend thy care!\nThis day my hand thy tender age shall shield,\nAnd crown with honours of the conquered field:\nThou when thy riper years shall send thee forth\nTo toils of war, be mindful of my worth;\nAssert thy birthright, and in arms be known,\nFor Hector’s nephew and Aeneas’ son.</p><p>Virgil, though born to shine by his own intrinsic powers, certainly owed much of his excellence to the wonderful merits of Homer. His susceptible imagination, vivid and correct, was  impregnated by the Odyssey, and warmed with the fire of the Iliad. Rivalling, or rather on some occasions surpassing his glorious predecessor in the characters of heroes and of gods, he sustains their dignity with so uniform a lustre, that they seem indeed more than mortal.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Whether the Iliad or the Aeneid be the more perfect</p>",
  "page-358": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">composition, is a question which has often been agitated, but perhaps will never be determined to general satisfaction. In comparing the genius of the two poets, however, allowance ought to be made for the difference of circumstances under which they composed their respective works. Homer wrote in an age when mankind had not as yet made any great progress in the exertion of either intellect or imagination, and he was therefore indebted for big resources to the vast capacity of his own mind. To this we must add, that he composed both his poems in a situation of life extremely unfavourable to the cultivation of poetry. Virgil, on the contrary, lived at a period when literature had attained to a high state of improvement. He had likewise not only the advantage of finding a model in the works of Homer, but of perusing the laws of epic poetry, which had been digested by Aristotle, and the various observations</p>",

In what time Homer composed either of his poems, we know not; but the Aeneid, we are informed, was the employment of Virgil during eleven years. For some years, the repeated entreaties of Augustus could not extort from him the smallest specimen of the work; but at length, when considerably advanced in it, he condescended to</p>",
  "page-360": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">recite three books—the second, the fourth, and the sixth—in the presence of the emperor and his sister Octavia, to gratify the latter of whom, in particular, the recital of the last book now mentioned, was intended. When the poet came to the words, Tu Marcellus eris, alluding to Octavia’s son, a youth of great hopes, who had lately died, the mother fainted. After she had recovered from this fit, by the care of her attendants, she ordered ten sesterces to be given to Virgil for every line relating  to that subject; a gratuity which amounted to about two thousand pounds sterling.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the composition of the Aeneid, Virgil scrupled not to introduce whole lines of Homer, and of the Latin poet Ennius; many of whose sentences he admired.

  "page-361": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he might have their opinion. On such occasions, it was usual with him to consult in particular his freedman and librarian Erotes, an old domestic, who, it is related, supplied extempore a deficiency in two lines, and was desired by his master to write them in the manuscript.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When this immortal work was completed, Virgil resolved on retiring into Greece and Asia for three years, that he might devote himself entirely to polishing it, and have leisure afterwards to pass the remainder of his life in the cultivation of philosophy. But meeting at Athens with Augustus, who was on his return from the East, he determined on accompanying the emperor back to Rome. Upon a visit to Megara, a town in the neighbourhood of Athens, he was seized with a languor, which increased during the ensuing voyage; and he expired a few days after landing at Brundisium, on the 22nd of September, in the fifty-second year of his age.

He was subject to complaints of the stomach and throat, as well as to head-ache, and had frequent discharges of blood upwards: but from what part, we are not informed. He was very temperate both in food and wine. His modesty was so great, that at Naples they commonly gave him the name of Parthenias, “the modest man.” On the subject of his modesty; the following anecdote is related.</p><p>Having written a distich, in which he compared Augustus to Jupiter, he placed it in the night-time over the gate of the emperor’s palace.

They seem all to have differed from one another, no less in the kind of measure which they chiefly or solely employed, than in the strength or softness, the beauty or grandeur, the animated rapidity or the graceful ease of their various compositions.

Satire is a species of composition, of which the Greeks furnished no model; and the preceding Roman writers of this class, though they had much improved it from its original rudeness and licentiousness, had still not brought it to that degree of perfection which might answer the purpose of moral reform in a polished state of society.

Horace died in the fifty-seventh year of his age, surviving his beloved Mecaenas only three weeks; a circumstance which, added to the declaration in an ode  to that personage, supposed to have been written in Mecaenas’s last illness, has given rise to a conjecture, that Horace ended his days by a violent death, to accompany his friend.

On his return to Rome, in obedience to the desire of his father, he entered upon the offices of public life in the forum, and declaimed with great applause. But this was the effect of paternal authority, not of choice: for, from his earliest years, he discovered an extreme attachment</p>",

The design of them was to deliver an account of the Roman festivals in every month of the year, with a description of the rites and ceremonies, as well as the sacrifices on those occasions. It is to be regretted, that, on a subject so interesting, this valuable work should not have been transmitted entire: but in the part which remains, we are furnished with a beautiful description of the ceremonial transactions in the Roman calendar, from the first of January to the end of June. The versification, as in all the compositions of this author, is easy and harmonious.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The most popular production of this poet is his Metamorphoses, not less extraordinary for the nature of the subject, than for the admirable art with which the</p>",

Those Ovid has not only so happily arranged, that they form a coherent series of narratives, one rising out of another; but he describes the different changes with such an imposing plausibility, as to give a natural appearance to the most incredible fictions. This ingenious production, however perfect it may appear, we are told by himself, had not received his last corrections when he was ordered into banishment.</p><p>In the Ibis, the author imitates a poem of the same name, written by Callimachus.

  "page-385": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">established, that Ovid had seen something of a very indecent nature, in which Augustus was concerned. What this was, is the question. Some authors, conceiving it to have been of a kind extremely atrocious, have gone so far as to suppose, that it must have been an act of criminality between Augustus and his own daughter Julia, who, notwithstanding the strict attention paid to her education by her father, became a woman of the most infamous character; suspected of incontinence during her marriage with Agrippa, and openly profligate after her union with her next husband, Tiberius. This supposition, however, rests entirely upon conjecture, and is not only discredited by its own improbability, but by a yet more forcible argument. It is certain that Julia was at this time in banishment for her scandalous life. She was about the same age with Tiberius, who was now forty seven, and they had not cohabited for many years. We know not</p>",
  "page-386": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">exactly the year in which Augustus sent her into exile, but we may conclude with confidence, that it happened soon after her separation from Tiberius; whose own interest with the emperor, as well as that of his mother Livia, could not fail of being exerted, if any such application was necessary, towards removing from the capital a woman, who, by the notoriety of her prostitution, reflected disgrace upon all with whom she was connected, either by blood or alliance. But no application from Tiberius or his mother could be necessary, when we are assured that Augustus even presented to the senate a narrative respecting the infamous behaviour of his daughter, which was read by the quaestor. He was so much ashamed of her profligacy, that he for a long time declined all company, and had thoughts of putting her to death. She was banished to an island on the coast of Campania for five years; at the expiration of which period, she was</p>",
  "page-387": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">removed to the continent, and the severity of her treatment a little mitigated; but though frequent applications were made in her behalf by the people, Augustus never could be prevailed upon to permit her return.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Other writers have conjectured, that, instead of Julia, the daughter of Augustus, the person seen with him by Ovid may have been Julia his grand-daughter, who inherited the vicious disposition of her mother, and was on that account likewise banished by Augustus. The epoch of this lady’s banishment it is impossible to ascertain; and therefore no argument can be drawn from that source to invalidate the present conjecture. But Augustus had shown the same solicitude for her being trained up in virtuous habits, as he had done in respect of her mother, though in both cases unsuccessfully; and this consideration, joined to the enormity of the supposed crime, and the great</p>",
  "page-388": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sensibility which Augustus had discovered with regard to the infamy of his daughter, seems sufficient to exonerate his memory from so odious a charge. Besides, is it possible that he could have sent her into banishment for the infamy of her prostitution, while  she was mistress of so important a secret, as that he himself had been more criminal with her than any other man in the empire?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Some writers, giving a wider scope to conjecture, have supposed the transaction to be of a nature still more detestable, and have even dragged Mecaenas, the minister, into a participation of the crime. Fortunately, however, for the reputation of the illustrious patron of polite learning, as well as for that of the emperor, this crude conjecture may be refuted upon the evidence of chronology. The commencement of Ovid’s exile happened in the ninth year of the Christian aera, and the death of Mecaenas, eight years before that period.</p>",
  "page-389": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Between this and other calculations, we find a difference of three or four years; but allowing the utmost latitude of variation, there intervened, from the death of Mecaenas to the banishment of Ovid, a period of eleven years; an observation which fully invalidates the conjecture above-mentioned.</p><p>Having now refuted, as it is presumed, the opinions of the different commentators on this subject, we shall proceed to offer a new conjecture, which seems to have a greater claim to probability than any that has hitherto been suggested.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Suetonius informs us, that Augustus, in the latter part of his life, contracted a vicious inclination for the enjoyment of young virgins, who were procured for him from all parts, not only with the connivance, but by the clandestine management of his consort Livia. It was therefore probably with one of those victims that he was discovered by Ovid. Augustus had for many</p>",
  "page-390": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">years affected a decency of behaviour, and he would, therefore, naturally be not a little disconcerted at the unseasonable intrusion of the poet. That Ovid knew not of Augustus’s being in the place, is beyond all doubt: and Augustus’s consciousness  of this circumstance, together with the character of Ovid, would suggest an unfavourable suspicion of the motive which had brought the latter thither. Abstracted from the immorality of the emperor’s own conduct, the incident might be regarded as ludicrous, and certainly was more fit to excite the shame than the indignation of Augustus. But the purpose of Ovid’s visit appears, from his own acknowledgment, to have been not entirely free from blame, though of what nature we know not:</p><p>Non equidem totam possum defendere culpam:\nSed partem nostri criminis error habet.\nDe Trist. Lib. iii. Eleg. 5.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I know I cannot wholly be defended,\nYet plead ‘twas</p>",

This passion, therefore, concurring with that which arose from the interruption or disappointment of gratification, inflamed the emperor’s resentment, and he resolved on banishing to a distant country a man whom he considered as his rival, and whose presence, from what had happened, he never more could endure.</p><p>Augustus having determined on the banishment of Ovid, could find little difficulty in accommodating the ostensible to the secret and real cause of this resolution.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">No argument to establish the date of publication, can be drawn from the order in which the various productions of Ovid are placed in the collection of his works: but reasoning from probability, we should</p>",
  "page-392": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">suppose that the Ars Amandi was written during the period of his youth; and this seems to be confirmed by the following passage in the second book of the Fasti:</p><p>Certe ego vos habui faciles in amore ministros;\nCum lusit numeris prima juventa suis.</p><p>That many years must have elapsed since its original publication, is evident from the subsequent lines in the second book of the Tristia:</p><p>Nos quoque jam pridem scripto peccavimus uno.\nSupplicium patitur non nova culpa novum.\nCarminaque edideram, cum te delicta notantem\nPraeterii toties jure quietus eques.\nErgo, quae juveni mihi non nocitura putavi\nScripta parum prudens, nunc nocuere seni?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With what show, then, of justice, it may be asked, could Augustus now punish a fault, which, in his solemn capacity of censor, he had so long and repeatedly overlooked? The answer is obvious: in a</p>",
  "page-393": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">production so popular as we may be assured the Ars Amandi was amongst the Roman youth, it must have passed through several editions in the course of some years: and one of those coinciding with the fatal discovery, afforded the emperor a specious pretext for the execution of his purpose. The severity exercised on this occasion, however, when the poet was suddenly driven into exile, unaccompanied even by the partner of his bed, who had been his companion for many years, was an act so inconsistent with the usual moderation of Augustus, that we cannot justly ascribe it to any other motive than personal resentment; especially as this arbitrary punishment of the author could answer no end of public utility, while the obnoxious production remained to affect, if it really ever did essentially affect, the morals of society. If the sensibility of Augustus could not thenceforth admit of any personal intercourse with Ovid, or even of his living within the limits of</p>",
  "page-394": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Italy, there would have been little danger from the example, in sending into honourable exile, with every indulgence which could alleviate so distressful a necessity, a man of respectable rank in the state, who was charged with no actual offence against the laws, and whose genius, with all its indiscretion, did immortal honour to his country. It may perhaps be urged, that, considering the predicament in which Augustus stood, he discovered a forbearance greater than might have been expected from an absolute prince, in sparing the life of Ovid. It will readily be granted, that Ovid, in the same circumstances, under any one of the four subsequent emperors, would have expiated the incident with his blood. Augustus, upon a late occasion, had shown himself equally sanguinary, for he put to death, by the hand of Varus, a poet of Parma, named Cassius, on account of his having written some satirical verses against him. By that recent example, therefore, and the</p>",
  "page-395": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">power of pardoning which the emperor still retained, there was sufficient hold of the poet’s secrecy respecting the fatal transaction, which, if divulged  to the world, Augustus would reprobate as a false and infamous libel, and punish the author accordingly. Ovid, on his part, was sensible, that, should he dare to violate the important but tacit injunction, the imperial vengeance would reach him even on the shores of the Euxine. It appears, however, from a passage in the Ibis, which can apply to no other than Augustus, that Ovid was not sent into banishment destitute of pecuniary provision:</p><p>Di melius! quorum longe mihi maximus ille,\nQui nostras inopes noluit esse vias.\nHuic igitur meritas grates, ubicumque licebit,\nPro tam mansueto pectore semper agam.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The gods defend! of whom he’s far the chief,\nWho lets me not, though banished, want relief.\nFor this his favour therefore whilst I live,\nWhere’er I am, deserved</p>",
  "page-396": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thanks I’ll give.</p><p>What sum the emperor bestowed, for the support of a banishment which he was resolved should be perpetual, it is impossible to ascertain; but he had formerly been liberal to Ovid, as well as to other poets.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">If we might hazard a conjecture respecting the scene of the intrigue which occasioned the banishment of Ovid, we should place it in some recess in the emperor’s gardens. His house, though called Palatium, the palace, as being built on the Palatine hill, and inhabited by the sovereign, was only a small mansion, which had formerly belonged to Hortensius, the orator. Adjoining to this place Augustus had built the temple of Apollo, which he endowed with a public library, and allotted for the use of poets, to recite their compositions to each other. Ovid was particularly intimate with Hyginus, one of Augustus’s freedmen, who was librarian of the temple. He might therefore have been in the library, and</p>",

Notwithstanding the lascivious writings of Ovid, it does not appear that he was in his conduct a libertine. He was three times married: his first wife, who was of mean extraction, and  whom he had married when he was very young, he divorced; the second he dismissed on account of her immodest behaviour; and the third appears to have survived him.

But an indisposition with which he was seized, and a natural aversion to the toils of war, induced him to return to Rome, where he seems to have resigned himself to a life of indolence and pleasure, amidst which he devoted a part of his time to the composition of elegies. Elegiac poetry had been cultivated by several Greek writers, particularly Callimachus, Mimnermus, and Philetas; but, so far as we can find, had, until the present age, been unknown to the Romans in their own tongue.

  "page-399": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">friendship, and might, indeed, be used upon almost any subject; though, from the limp in the pentameter line, it is not suitable to sublime subjects, which require a fulness of expression, and an expansion of sound. To this species of poetry Tibullus restricted his application, by which he cultivated that simplicity and tenderness, and agreeable ease of sentiment, which constitute the characteristic perfections of the elegiac muse.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the description of rural scenes, the peaceful occupations of the field, the charms of domestic happiness, and the joys of reciprocal love, scarcely any poet surpasses Tibullus. His luxuriant imagination collects the most beautiful flowers of nature, and he displays them with all the delicate attraction of soft and harmonious numbers. With a dexterity peculiar to himself, in whatever subject he engages, he leads his readers imperceptibly through devious paths of pleasure, of which, at the outset of the poem, they</p>",
  "page-400": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">could form no conception. He seems to have often written without any previous meditation or design. Several of his elegies may be said to have neither middle nor end: yet the transitions are so natural, and the gradations so easy, that though we wander through Elysian scenes of fancy, the most heterogeneous in their nature, we are sensible of no defect in the concatenation which has joined them together. It is, however, to be regretted that, in some instances, Tibullus betrays that licentiousness of manners which  formed too general a characteristic even of this refined age. His elegies addressed to Messala contain a beautiful amplification of sentiments founded in friendship and esteem, in which it is difficult to say, whether the virtues of the patron or the genius of the poet be more conspicuous.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Valerius Messala Corvinus, whom he celebrates, was descended of a very ancient family. In the civil wars which followed the death of Julius Caesar he joined the</p>",
  "page-401": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">republican party, and made himself master of the camp of Octavius at Philippi; but he was afterwards reconciled to his opponent, and lived to an advanced age in favour and esteem with Augustus. He was distinguished not only by his military talents, but by his eloquence, integrity, and patriotism.</p><p>From the following passage in the writings of Tibullus, commentators have conjectured that he was deprived of his lands by the same proscription in which those of Virgil had been involved:</p><p>Cui fuerant flavi ditantes ordine sulci\nHorrea, faecundas ad deficientia messes,\nCuique pecus denso pascebant agmine colles,\nEt domino satis, et nimium furique lupoque:\nNunc desiderium superest: nam cura novatur,\nCum memor anteactos semper dolor admovet annos.\nLib. iv.

Were it true, as is said by biographers, that he was born the same day with Ovid, we must indeed assign the event to an early period: for Ovid cannot have written the elegy after the forty-third year of his own life, and how long before is uncertain. In the tenth elegy of the fourth book, De Tristibus, he observes, that the fates had allowed little time for the cultivation of his friendship with Tibullus.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Virgilium vidi tantum: nec avara Tibullo\nTempus amicitiae fata dedere meae.\nSuccessor fuit hic tibi, Galle; Propertius illi:\nQuartus ab his serie temporis ipse</p>",

It is evident, however, that biographers have committed a mistake with regard to the birth of this poet; for in the passage above cited of the Tristia, Ovid mentions Tibullus as a writer, who, though his contemporary, was much older than himself. From this passage we should be justified in placing the death of Tibullus between the fortieth and fiftieth year</p>",
  "page-404": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of his age, and rather nearer to the latter period; for, otherwise, Horace would scarcely have mentioned him in the manner he does in one of his epistles.</p><p>Albi, nostrorum sermonum candide judex,\nQuid nunc te dicam facere in regione Pedana?\nScribere quod Cassi Parmensis opuscula vincat;\nAn tacitum silvas inter reptare salubres,\nCurantem quicquid dignam sapiente bonoque est?—Epist. i. 4.</p><p>Albius, in whom my satires find\nA critic, candid, just, and kind,\nDo you, while at your country seat,\nSome rhyming labours meditate,\nThat shall in volumed bulk arise,\nAnd e’en from Cassius bear the prize;\nOr saunter through the silent wood,\nMusing on what befits the good.—Francis.</p><p>This supposition is in no degree inconsistent with the authority of Ovid, where he mentions him as a young man; for the Romans extended the period of youth to the fiftieth year.——</p>",

Of his poetry we have only six elegies, written, in the person of an old man, on the subject of old age, but which, there is reason to think, were composed at an earlier part of the author’s life. Except the fifth elegy, which is tainted with immodesty, the others, particularly the first, are highly beautiful, and may be placed in competition with any other productions of the elegiac kind. Gallus was, for some time, in great favour with Augustus, who appointed him governor of Egypt. It is said, however,</p>",
  "page-408": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that he not only oppressed the province by extortion, but entered into a conspiracy against his benefactor, for which he was banished.

Upon the final termination of the Punic war, and the conquest of Greece, their ardour, which had hitherto been exercised in military achievements, was diverted</p>",
  "page-410": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">into the channel of literature; and the civil commotions which followed, having now ceased, a fresh impulse was given to activity in the ambitious pursuit of the laurel, which was now only to be obtained by glorious exertions of intellect. The beautiful productions of Greece, operating strongly upon their minds, excited them to imitation; imitation, when roused amongst a number, produced emulation; and emulation cherished an extraordinary thirst of fame, which, in every exertion of the human mind, is the parent of excellence. This liberal contention was not a little promoted by the fashion introduced at Rome, for poets to recite their compositions in public; a practice which seems to have been carried even to a ridiculous excess.—Such was now the rage for poetical composition in the Roman capital, that Horace describes it in the following terms:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Mutavit mentem populus levis, et calet uno\nScribendi studio: pueri patresque severi\nFronde comas</p>",

  "page-413": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">poets of this period displayed, both in the composition, and the polishing of their works. Virgil, when employed upon the Georgics, usually wrote in the morning, and applied much of the subsequent part of the day to correction and improvement. He compared himself to a bear, that licks her cub into form. If this was his regular practice in the Georgics, we may justly suppose that it was the same in the Aeneid. Yet, after all this labour, he intended to devote three years entirely to its farther amendment. Horace has gone so far in recommending careful correction, that he figuratively mentions nine years as an adequate period for that purpose. But whatever may be the time, there is no precept which he urges either oftener or more forcibly, than a due attention to this important subject.</p><p>Saepe stylum vertas, iterum quae digna legi sint\nScripturus.—Sat. i. x.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Would you a reader’s just esteem engage?\nCorrect</p>",

  "page-415": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">imperial favour, and the animating patronage of Mecaenas, experienced a poetic enthusiasm which approached to real inspiration.</p><p>Having now finished the proposed explanation, relative to the celebrity of the Augustan age, we shall conclude with recapitulating in a few words the causes of this extraordinary occurrence.</p><p>The models, then, which the Romans derived from Grecian poetry, were the finest productions of human genius; their incentives to emulation were the strongest that could actuate the heart.

This Being Not Rightly Understood By Those About Him, The Sick Were Brought Into A Public Portico, And Ranged In Order, According To Their Several Distempers. Being Extremely Embarrassed By This Unexpected Occurrence, He Was For Some Time Irresolute How He Should Act; But At Last He Determined To Go Round Them All, And Make An Apology For The Mistake Even To The Meanest Amongst Them, And Such As Were Entirely Unknown To Him. One Instance Only Is Mentioned, In Which He Appeared To Exercise His Tribunitian Authority. Being A Constant Attendant Upon The Schools And Lecture-rooms Of The Professors Of The Liberal Arts, On Occasion Of A Quarrel Amongst The Wrangling  Sophists, In Which He Interposed To Reconcile Them, Some Person Took The Liberty To Abuse Him As An Intruder, And Partial In The Affair. Upon This, Withdrawing Privately Home, He Suddenly Returned Attended By His Officers, And Summoning His Accuser Before His Tribunal, By A Public Crier, Ordered Him To Be Taken To Prison. Afterwards He Received Tidings That His Wife Julia Had Been Condemned For Her Lewdness And Adultery, And That A Bill Of Divorce Had Been Sent To Her In His Name, By The Authority Of Augustus. Though He Secretly Rejoiced At This Intelligence, He Thought It Incumbent Upon Him, In Point Of Decency, To Interpose In Her Behalf By Frequent Letters To Augustus, And To Allow Her To Retain The Presents Which He Had Made Her, Notwithstanding The Little Regard She Merited From Him. When The Period Of His Tribunitian Authority Expired , Declaring At Last That He Had No Other Object In His Retirement Than To Avoid All Suspicion Of Rivalship With Caius And Lucius, He Petitioned That, Since He Was Now Secure In That Respect, As They Were Come To The Age Of Manhood, And Would Easily Maintain Themselves In Possession Of The Second Place In The State, He Might Be Permitted To Visit His Friends, Whom He Was Very Desirous Of Seeing. But His Request Was Denied; And He Was Advised To Lay Aside All Concern For His Friends, Whom He Had Been So Eager To Greet.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Thenceforth Lived, However, Not Only As A Private Person, But As One Suspected And Under Apprehension, Retiring Into The Interior Of The Country, And Avoiding The Visits Of Those Who Sailed That Way, Which Were Very Frequent; For No One Passed To Take Command Of An Army, Or The Government Of A Province, Without Touching At Rhodes. But There Were Fresh Reasons For Increased Anxiety. For Crossing Over To Samos, On A Visit To His Step-son Caius, Who Had Been Appointed Governor Of The East, He Found Him Prepossessed Against Him, By The Insinuations Of Marcus Lollius, His Companion And Director. He Likewise Fell Under Suspicion Of Sending By Some Centurions Who Had Been Promoted By Himself, Upon Their Return To The Camp After A Furlough, Mysterious Messages To Several Persons There, Intended, Apparently, To  Tamper With Them For A Revolt. This Jealousy Respecting His Designs Being Intimated To Him By Augustus, He Begged Repeatedly That Some Person Of Any Of The Three Orders Might Be Placed As A Spy Upon Him In Every Thing He Either Said Or Did.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Thus Alarmed Not Only By Apprehensions, But Real Danger, He Renewed His Solicitations For Leave To Return; And, Seconded By The Most Urgent Supplications Of His Mother, He At Last Obtained His Request; To Which An Accident Somewhat Contributed. Augustus Had Resolved To Determine Nothing In The Affair, But With The Consent Of His Eldest Son. The Latter Was At That Time Out Of Humour With Marcus Lollius, And Therefore Easily Disposed To Be Favourable To His Father-in-law. Caius Thus Acquiescing, He Was Recalled, But Upon Condition That He Should Take No Concern Whatever In The Administration Of Affairs.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Returned To Rome After An Absence Of Nearly Eight Years , With Great And Confident Hopes Of His Future Elevation, Which He Had Entertained From His Youth, In Consequence Of Various Prodigies And Predictions. For Livia, When Pregnant With Him, Being Anxious To Discover, By Different Modes Of Divination, Whether Her Offspring Would Be A Son, Amongst Others, Took An Egg From A Hen That Was Sitting, And Kept It Warm With Her Own Hands, And Those Of Her Maids, By Turns, Until A Fine Cock-chicken, With A Large Comb, Was Hatched. Scribonius, The Astrologer, Predicted Great Things Of Him When He Was A Mere Child. “He Will Come In Time,” Said The Prophet, “To Be Even A King, But Without The Usual Badge Of Royal Dignity;” The Rule Of The Caesars Being As Yet Unknown. When He Was  Making His First Expedition, And Leading His Army Through Macedonia Into Syria, The Altars Which Had Been Formerly Consecrated At Philippi By The Victorious Legions, Blazed Suddenly With Spontaneous Fires. Soon After, As He Was Marching To Illyricum, He Stopped To Consult The Oracle Of Geryon, Near Padua; And Having Drawn A Lot By Which He Was Desired To Throw Golden Tali Into The Fountain Of Aponus , For An Answer To His Inquiries, He Did So, And The Highest Numbers Came Up. And Those Very Tali Are Still To Be Seen At The Bottom Of The Fountain. A Few Days Before His Leaving Rhodes, An Eagle, A Bird Never Before Seen In That Island, Perched On The Top Of His House. And The Day Before He Received Intelligence Of The Permission Granted Him To Return, As He Was Changing His Dress, His Tunic Appeared To Be All On Fire. He Then Likewise Had A Remarkable Proof Of The Skill Of Thrasyllus, The Astrologer, Whom, For His Proficiency In Philosophical Researches, He Had Taken Into His Family. For, Upon Sight Of The Ship Which Brought The Intelligence, He Said, Good News Was Coming Whereas Every Thing Going Wrong Before, And Quite Contrary To His Predictions, Tiberius Had Intended That Very Moment, When They Were Walking Together, To Throw Him Into The Sea, As An Impostor, And One To Whom He Had Too Hastily Entrusted His Secrets.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

But Caius And Lucius Being Both Carried Off In The Space Of Three Years, He Was Adopted By Augustus, Along With Their Brother Agrippa; Being Obliged In The First Place To Adopt Germanicus, His Brother’s Son. After His Adoption, He Never More Acted As Master Of A  Family, Nor Exercised, In The Smallest Degree, The Rights Which He Had Lost By It. For He Neither Disposed Of Anything In The Way Of Gift, Nor Manumitted A Slave; Nor So Much As Received Any Estate Left Him By Will, Nor Any Legacy, Without Reckoning It As A Part Of His Peculium Or Property Held Under His Father. From That Day Forward, Nothing Was Omitted That Might Contribute To The Advancement Of His Grandeur, And Much More, When, Upon Agrippa Being Discarded And Banished, It Was Evident That The Hope Of Succession Rested Upon Him Alone.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

This He Conducted During Three Years, With Fifteen Legions And An Equal Number Of Auxiliary Forces, Under Great Difficulties, And An Extreme Scarcity Of Corn. And Though He Was Several Times Recalled, He Nevertheless Persisted; Fearing Lest An Enemy So Powerful, And So Near, Should Fall Upon The Army In Their Retreat. This Resolution Was Attended With Good Success; For He At Last Reduced To Complete Subjection All Illyricum, Lying Between Italy And The Kingdom Of Noricum, Thrace, Macedonia, The River Danube, And The Adriatic Gulf.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

A Triumph, Therefore, Besides Many Other Great Honours, Was Decreed Him. Some Proposed That The Surname Of “Pannonicus,” Others That Of “Invincible,” And Others, Of “O Pius,” Should Be Conferred On Him; But Augustus Interposed, Engaging For Him That He Would Be Satisfied With That To Which He Would Succeed At His Death. He Postponed His Triumph, Because  The State Was At That Time Under Great Affliction For The Disaster Of Varus And His Army. Nevertheless, He Entered The City In A Triumphal Robe, Crowned With Laurel, And Mounting A Tribunal In The Septa, Sat With Augustus Between The Two Consuls, Whilst The Senate Gave Their Attendance Standing; Whence, After He Had Saluted The People, He Was Attended By Them In Procession To The Several Temples.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Likewise Used More Cautions Than Usual. Having To Pass The Rhine, He Restricted The Whole Convoy Within Certain Limits, And Stationing Himself On The Bank Of The River, Would Not Suffer The Waggons To Cross The River, Until He Had Searched Them At The Water-side, To See That They Carried Nothing But What Was Allowed Or Necessary. Beyond The Rhine, Such Was His Way Of Living, That He Took His Meals Sitting On The Bare Ground , And Often Passed The Night Without A Tent; And His Regular Orders For The Day, As Well As Those Upon Sudden Emergencies, He Gave In Writing, With This Injunction, That In Case Of Any Doubt As To The Meaning Of Them, They Should Apply To Him For Satisfaction, Even At Any Hour Of The Night.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Though It Was His Desire To Leave As Little As Possible In The Power Of Fortune Or Accident, Yet He Always Engaged The Enemy With More Confidence When, In His Night-watches, The Lamp Failed And Went Out Of Itself; Trusting, As He Said, In An Omen Which Had Never Failed Him And His Ancestors  In All Their Commands.

Augustus’s Will Was Then Brought In, And Read By A Freedman; None Of The Witnesses To It Being Admitted, But Such As Were Of The Senatorian Order, The Rest Owning Their Hand-writing Without Doors. The Will Began Thus: “Since My Ill-fortune Has Deprived Me Of My Two Sons, Caius And Lucius, Let Tiberius Caesar Be Heir To Two-thirds Of My Estate.” These Words Countenanced The Suspicion Of Those Who Were Of Opinion, That Tiberius Was Appointed Successor More Out Of Necessity Than Choice, Since Augustus Could Not Refrain From Prefacing His Will In That Manner.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

The Cause Of His Long Demur Was Fear Of The Dangers Which Threatened Him On All Hands; Insomuch That He Said, “I Have Got A Wolf By The Ears.” For A Slave Of Agrippa’s, Clemens By Name, Had Drawn Together A Considerable Force To Revenge His Master’s Death; Lucius Scribonius Libo, A Senator Of The First Distinction, Was Secretly Fomenting A Rebellion; And The Troops Both In Illyricum And Germany Were Mutinous. Both Armies Insisted Upon High Demands, Particularly That Their Pay Should Be Made Equal To That Of The Pretorian Guards. The Army In Germany Absolutely Refused To Acknowledge A Prince Who Was Not Their Own Choice; And Urged, With All Possible Importunity, Germanicus , Who Commanded Them, To Take The Government On Himself, Though He Obstinately Refused It. It Was Tiberius’s Apprehension From This Quarter, Which Made Him Request The Senate To Assign Him Some Part Only In The Administration, Such As They Should Judge Proper, Since No Man Could Be Sufficient For The Whole, Without One Or More To Assist Him. He Pretended Likewise To Be In A Bad State Of Health, That Germanicus Might The More Patiently Wait In Hopes Of Speedily Succeeding Him, Or At Least Of Being  Admitted To Be A Colleague In The Government. When The Mutinies In The Armies Were Suppressed, He Got Clemens Into His Hands By Stratagem. That He Might Not Begin His Reign By An Act Of Severity, He Did Not Call Libo To An Account Before The Senate Until His Second Year, Being Content, In The Mean Time, With Taking Proper Precautions For His Own Security. For Upon Libo’s Attending A Sacrifice Amongst The High-priests, Instead Of The Usual Knife, He Ordered One Of Lead To Be Given Him; And When He Desired A Private Conference With Him, He Would Not Grant His Request, But On Condition That His Son Drusus Should Be Present; And As They Walked Together, He Held Him Fast By The Right Hand, Under The Pretence Of Leaning Upon Him, Until The Conversation Was Over.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He First Fell Upon The Friends And Acquaintance Of His Mother, Then Those Of His Grandsons, And His Daughter-in-law, And Lastly Those Of Sejanus; After Whose Death He Became Cruel In The Extreme. From This It Appeared, That He Had Not Been So Much Instigated By Sejanus, As Supplied With Occasions Of Gratifying His Savage Temper, When He Wanted Them.

It Would Be Tedious To Relate All The Numerous Instances Of His Cruelty: Suffice It To Give A Few Examples, In Their Different Kinds. Not A Day Passed Without The Punishment Of Some Person Or Other, Not Excepting Holidays, Or Those Appropriated To The Worship Of The Gods. Some Were Tried Even On New-year’s-day. Of Many Who Were Condemned, Their Wives And Children Shared The Same Fate; And For Those Who Were Sentenced To Death, The Relations Were Forbid To Put On Mourning. Considerable Rewards Were Voted For The Prosecutors, And Sometimes For The Witnesses Also. The Information Of Any Person, Without Exception, Was Taken; And All Offences Were Capital, Even Speaking  A Few Words, Though Without Any Ill Intention. A Poet Was Charged With Abusing Agamemnon; And A Historian , For Calling Brutus And Cassius “The Last Of The Romans.” The Two Authors Were Immediately Called To Account, And Their Writings Suppressed; Though They Had Been Well Received Some Years Before, And Read In The Hearing Of Augustus. Some, Who Were Thrown Into Prison, Were Not Only Denied The Solace Of Study, But Debarred From All Company And Conversation. Many Persons, When Summoned To Trial, Stabbed Themselves At Home, To Avoid The Distress And Ignominy Of A Public Condemnation, Which They Were Certain Would Ensue. Others Took Poison In The Senate House. The Wounds Were Bound Up, And All Who Had Not Expired, Were Carried, Half-dead, And Panting For Life, To Prison. Those Who Were Put To Death, Were Thrown Down The Gemonian Stairs, And Then Dragged Into The Tiber. In One Day, Twenty Were Treated In This Manner; And Amongst Them Women And Boys. Because, According To An Ancient Custom, It Was Not Lawful To Strangle Virgins, The Young Girls Were First Deflowered By The Executioner, And Afterwards Strangled. Those Who Were Desirous To Die, Were Forced To Live. For He Thought Death So Slight A Punishment, That Upon Hearing That Carnulius, One Of The Accused, Who Was Under Prosecution, Had Killed Himself, He Exclaimed, “Carnulius Has Escaped Me.” In Calling Over His Prisoners, When One Of Them Requested The Favour Of A Speedy Death, He Replied, “You Are Not Yet Restored To Favour.” A Man Of Consular Rank Writes In His Annals, That At Table, Where He Himself Was Present With A Large Company, He Was Suddenly Asked Aloud By A Dwarf Who Stood By Amongst The Buffoons, Why Paconius, Who Was Under A Prosecution For Treason, Lived So Long. Tiberius Immediately Reprimanded Him For His Pertness; But Wrote To The Senate A Few Days After, To Proceed Without Delay To The Punishment Of Paconius.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Was So Entirely Occupied With The Examination Of This Affair, For Whole Days Together, That, Upon Being Informed That The Person In Whose House He Had Lodged At Rhodes, And Whom He Had By A Friendly Letter Invited To Rome, Was Arrived, He Ordered Him Immediately To Be Put To The Torture, As A Party Concerned In The Enquiry. Upon Finding His Mistake, He Commanded Him To Be Put To Death, That He Might Not Publish The Injury Done Him. The Place Of Execution Is Still Shown At Capri, Where He Ordered Those Who Were Condemned To Die, After Long And Exquisite Tortures, To Be Thrown, Before His Eyes, From A Precipice Into The Sea. There A Party Of Soldiers Belonging To The Fleet Waited For Them, And Broke Their Bones With Poles And Oars, Lest They Should Have Any Life Left In Them.

Tiberius, the adopted son of the former sovereign, was of mature age; and though he had hitherto lived, for the most part, abstracted from any concern with public affairs, yet, having been brought up in the family of Augustus, he was acquainted with his method of government, which, there was reason to expect, he would render the model of his own. Livia, too, his mother, and the relict of the late emperor, was still living, a woman venerable by years, who had long been familiar with the councils of Augustus, and from her high rank, as well as uncommon affability, possessed an extensive influence amongst all classes of the people.</p>",
  "page-504": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Such were the circumstances in favour of Tiberius’s succession at the demise of Augustus; but there were others of a tendency disadvantageous to his views. His temper was haughty and reserved: Augustus had often apologised for the ungraciousness of his manners. He was disobedient to his mother; and though he had not openly discovered any propensity to vice, he enjoyed none of those qualities which usually conciliate popularity. To these considerations it is to be added, that Postumus Agrippa, the grandson of Augustus by Julia, was living; and if consanguinity was to be the rule of succession, his right was indisputably preferable to that of an adopted son. Augustus had sent this youth into exile a few years before; but, towards the close  of his life, had expressed a design of recalling him, with the view, as was supposed, of appointing him his successor. The father of young Agrippa had been greatly beloved by the Romans; and the fate of his mother, Julia,</p>",
  "page-505": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">though she was notorious for her profligacy, had ever been regarded by them with peculiar sympathy and tenderness. Many, therefore, attached to the son the partiality entertained for his parents; which was increased not only by a strong suspicion, but a general surmise, that his elder brothers, Caius and Lucius, had been violently taken off, to make way for the succession of Tiberius. That an obstruction was apprehended to Tiberius’s succession from this quarter, is put beyond all doubt, when we find that the death of Augustus was industriously kept secret, until young Agrippa should be removed; who, it is generally agreed, was dispatched by an order from Livia and Tiberius conjointly, or at least from the former. Though, by this act, there remained no rival to Tiberius, yet the consciousness of his own want of pretensions to the Roman throne, seems to have still rendered him distrustful of the succession; and that he should have quietly obtained it,</p>",

Drusus Calidianus and married Tiberius Claudius Nero, by whom she had two sons, Tiberius and Drusus. The conduct of this lady seems to justify the remark of Caligula, that “she was an Ulysses in a woman’s dress.” Octavius first saw her as she fled from the danger which threatened her husband, who had espoused the cause of Antony; and though she was then pregnant, he resolved to marry her; whether with her own inclination or not, is left by Tacitus undetermined. To pave the way for this union, he divorced his wife Scribonia, and with the approbation of the Augurs, which he could have no difficulty in obtaining, celebrated  his nuptials with Livia. There ensued from this marriage no issue, though much desired by both parties; but Livia retained, without interruption, an unbounded ascendancy over the emperor, whose confidence she abused, while the</p>",
  "page-508": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">uxorious husband little suspected that he was cherishing in his bosom a viper who was to prove the destruction of his house. She appears to have entertained a predominant ambition of giving an heir to the Roman empire; and since it could not be done by any fruit of her marriage with Augustus, she resolved on accomplishing that end in the person of Tiberius, the eldest son by her former husband. The plan which she devised for this purpose, was to exterminate all the male offspring of Augustus by his daughter Julia, who was married to Agrippa; a stratagem which, when executed, would procure for Tiberius, through the means of adoption, the eventual succession to the empire. The cool yet sanguinary policy, and the patient perseverance of resolution, with which she prosecuted her design, have seldom been equalled. While the sons of Julia were yet young, and while there was still a possibility that she herself might have issue by Augustus, she suspended her</p>",
  "page-509": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">project, in the hope, perhaps, that accident or disease might operate in its favour; but when the natural term of her constitution had put a period to her hopes of progeny, and when the grandsons of the emperor were risen to the years of manhood, and had been adopted by him, she began to carry into execution what she long had meditated. The first object devoted to destruction was C. Caesar Agrippa, the eldest of Augustus’s grandsons. This promising youth was sent to Armenia, upon an expedition against the Persians; and Lollius, who had been his governor, either accompanied him thither from Rome, or met him in the East, where he had obtained some appointment. From the hand of this traitor, perhaps under the pretext of exercising the authority of a preceptor, but in reality instigated by Livia, the young prince received a fatal blow, of which he died some time after.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The manner of Caius’s death seems to have been</p>",
  "page-510": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">carefully kept from the knowledge of Augustus, who promoted Lollius to the consulship, and made him governor of a province; but, by his rapacity in this station, he afterwards incurred the emperor’s displeasure. The true character of this person had escaped the keen discernment of Horace, as well as the sagacity of the emperor; for in two epistles addressed to Lollius, he mentions him as great and accomplished in the superlative degree; maxime Lolli, liberrime Lolli; so imposing had been the manners and address of this deceitful courtier.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Lucius, the second son of Julia, was banished into Campania,  for using, as it is said, so litious language against his grandfather.

  "page-511": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Postumus Agrippa, the third son, incurred the displeasure of his grandfather in the same way as Lucius, and was confined at Surrentum, where he remained a prisoner until he was put to death by the order either of Livia alone, or in conjunction with Tiberius, as was before observed.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Such was the catastrophe, through the means of Livia, of all the grandsons of Augustus; and reason justifies the inference, that she who scruple not to lay violent hands upon those young men, had formerly practised every artifice that could operate towards rendering them obnoxious to the emperor. We may even ascribe to her dark intrigues the dissolute conduct of Julia for the woman who could secretly act as procuress to her own husband, would feel little restraint upon her mind against corrupting his daughter, when such an effect might contribute to answer the purpose which she had in view. But in the ingratitude of</p>",

  "page-513": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">esteem. At the death of his grandfather Augustus, he was employed in a war in Germany, where he greatly distinguished himself by his military achievements; and as soon as intelligence of that event arrived, the soldiers, by whom he was extremely beloved, unanimously saluted him emperor. Refusing, however, to accept this mark of their partiality, he persevered in allegiance to the government of his uncle, and prosecuted the war with success. Upon the conclusion of this expedition, he was sent, with the title of emperor in the East, to repress the seditions of the Armenians, in which he was equally successful. But the  fame which he acquired, served only to render him an object of jealousy to Tiberius, by whose order he was secretly poisoned at Daphne, near Antioch, in the thirty-fourth year of his age.

He was celebrated for humanity and benevolence, as well as military talents, and amidst the toils of war, found leisure to cultivate the arts of literary genius. He composed two comedies in Greek, some epigrams, and a translation of Aratus into Latin verse. He married Agrippina, the daughter of M. Agrippa, by whom he had nine children. This lady, who had accompanied her husband into the east, carried his ashes to Italy, and accused his murderer, Piso; who, unable to bear up against the public odium incurred by that transaction, laid violent hands upon himself. Agrippina was now nearly in the same predicament with regard to Tiberius, that Ovid had formerly been in respect of Augustus. He was sensible, that when she accused Piso, she was not ignorant of the person by whom the perpetrator of the murder had been instigated; and her presence, therefore, seeming</p>",
  "page-516": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">continually to reproach him with his guilt, he resolved to rid himself of a person become so obnoxious to his sight, and banished her to the island of Pandataria, where she died some time afterwards of famine.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But it was not sufficient to gratify this sanguinary tyrant, that he had, without any cause, cut off both Germanicus and his wife Agrippina: the distinguished merits and popularity of that prince were yet to be revenged upon his children; and accordingly he  set himself to invent a pretext for their destruction. After endeavouring in vain, by various artifices, to provoke the resentment of Nero and Drusus against him, he had recourse to false accusation, and not only charged them with seditious designs, to which their tender years were ill adapted, but with vices of a nature the most scandalous. By a sentence of the senate, which manifested the extreme servility of that assembly, he procured them both to be declared open enemies to</p>",
  "page-517": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">their country. Nero he banished to the island of Pontia, where, like his unfortunate mother, he miserably perished by famine; and Drusus was doomed to the same fate, in the lower part of the Palatium, after suffering for nine days the violence of hunger, and having, as is related, devoured part of his bed. The remaining son, Caius, on account of his vicious disposition, he resolved to appoint his successor on the throne, that, after his own death, a comparison might be made in favour of his memory, when the Romans should be governed by a sovereign yet more vicious and more tyrannical, if possible, than himself.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Sejanus, the minister in the present reign, imitated with success, for some time, the hypocrisy of his master; and, had his ambitious temper, impatient of attaining its object, allowed him to wear the mask for a longer period, he might have gained the imperial diadem; in the pursuit of which he was overtaken by that fate</p>",
  "page-518": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">which he merited still more by his cruelties than his perfidy to Tiberius. This man was a native of Volsinium in Tuscany, and the son of a Roman knight. He had first insinuated himself into the favour of Caius Caesar, the grandson of Augustus, after whose death he courted the friendship of Tiberius, and obtained in a short time his entire confidence, which he improved to the best advantage. The object which he next pursued, was to gain the attachment of the senate, and the officers of the army; besides whom, with a new kind of policy, he endeavoured to secure in his interest every lady of distinguished connections, by giving secretly to each of them a promise of marriage, as soon as he should arrive at the sovereignty. The chief obstacles in his way were the sons and grandsons of Tiberius; and these he soon sacrificed to his ambition, under various pretences. Drusus, the eldest of this progeny, having in a fit of passion struck the favourite, was destined by him to</p>",

For this purpose, he had the presumption to seduce Livia, the wife of Drusus, to whom she had borne several children; and she consented to marry her adulterer upon the death of her husband, who was soon after poisoned, through the means of an eunuch named Lygdus, by order of her and Sejanus.</p><p>Drusus was the son of Tiberius by Vipsania, one of Agrippa’s  daughters. He displayed great intrepidity during the war in the provinces of Illyricum and Pannonia, but appears to have been dissolute in his morals. Horace is said to have written the Ode in praise of Drusus at the desire of Augustus; and while the poet celebrates the military courage of the prince, he insinuates indirectly a salutary admonition to the cultivation of the civil virtues:</p><p>Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,\nRectique cultus pectora roborant:\nUtcunque defecere mores,\nDedecorant bene nata culpae.—Ode iv. 4.</p>",

He therefore urged his demand with increased importunity; but the emperor still refusing his consent, and things being not yet ripe for an immediate revolt, Sejanus thought nothing so favourable for the prosecution of his designs as the absence of Tiberius from the capital. With this view, under the pretence of relieving his master from the cares</p>",
  "page-521": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">of government, he persuaded him to retire to a distance from Rome. The emperor, indolent and luxurious, approved of the proposal, and retired into Campania, leaving to his ambitious minister the whole direction of the empire. Had Sejanus now been governed by common prudence and moderation, he might have attained to the accomplishment of all his wishes; but a natural impetuosity of temper, and the intoxication of power, precipitated him into measures which soon effected his destruction. As if entirely emancipated from the control of a master, he publicly declared himself sovereign of the Roman empire, and that Tiberius, who had by this time retired to Capri, was only the dependent prince of that tributary island. He even went so far in degrading the emperor, as to have him introduced in a ridiculous light upon the stage.

Neither age nor sex afforded any exemption from his insatiable thirst for blood.

Fathers were constrained by violence to witness the death of their own children; and even the tears of a mother, at the execution of her child, were punished as a capital offence. Some extraordinary calamities, occasioned by accident, added to the horrors of the reign. A great number of houses on Mount Caelius were destroyed by fire; and by the fall of a temporary building at Fidenae, erected for the purpose of exhibiting public shows, about twenty thousand persons were either greatly hurt, or crushed to death in the rains.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">By another fire which afterwards broke out, a part of the Circus was destroyed, with the numerous buildings on Mount Aventine.

Affable on a few occasions, but in general averse to society, he indulged, from his earliest years, a moroseness of disposition, which counterfeited the appearance of austere virtue; and in the decline of life, when it is common to reform from juvenile indiscretions, he launched forth into excesses, of a kind the most unnatural and most detestable. Considering the vicious passions which had ever brooded in his heart, it may seem surprising that he restrained himself within the bounds of decency during so many years after his accession; but though utterly destitute of reverence or affection for his mother, he still felt, during her life, a filial awe upon his mind: and after her death, he was actuated by a slavish fear of Sejanus, until at last political necessity absolved him likewise from this</p>",

These checks being both removed,  he rioted without any control, either from sentiment or authority.</p><p>Pliny relates, that the art of making glass malleable was actually discovered under the reign of Tiberius, and that the shop and tools of the artist were destroyed, lest, by the establishment of this invention, gold and silver should lose their value.

The prodigious fame of the writers of the Augustan</p>",
  "page-526": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">age, by repressing emulation, tended to a general diminution of the efforts of genius for some time; while the banishment of Ovid, it is probable, and the capital punishment of a subsequent poet, for censuring the character of Agamemnon, operated towards the farther discouragement of poetical exertions. There now existed no circumstance to counterbalance these disadvantages. Genius no longer found a patron either in the emperor or his minister; and the gates of the palace were shut against all who cultivated the elegant pursuits of the Muses. Panders, catamites, assassins, wretches stained with every crime, were the constant attendants, as the only fit companions, of the tyrant who now occupied the throne. We are informed, however, that even this emperor had a taste for the liberal arts, and that he composed a lyric poem upon the death of Lucius Caesar, with some Greek poems in imitation of Euphorion, Rhianus, and Parthenius. But</p>",
  "page-527": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">none of these has been transmitted to posterity: and if we should form an opinion of them upon the principle of Catullus, that to be a good poet one ought to be a good man, there is little reason to regret that they have perished.</p><p>We meet with no poetical production in this reign; and of prose writers the number is inconsiderable, as will appear from the following account of them.——</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">VELLEIUS PATERCULUS was born of an equestrian family in Campania, and served as a military tribune under Tiberius, in his expeditions in Gaul and Germany.

He intimates a design of giving a more full account of the civil war which followed the death of Julius Caesar; but this, if he ever accomplished it, has not been transmitted to posterity. Candid, but decided in his judgment of motives and actions, if we except his invectives against Pompey, he shows little propensity to censure; but in awarding praise, he is not equally parsimonious, and, on some occasions, risks the imputation of hyperbole.

The subjects are of various kinds, political, moral, and natural, ranged into distinct classes. His transitions from one subject to another are often performed with gracefulness; and where he offers any remarks, they generally show the author to be a man of judgment and observation.

What inducement the author had to this dedication, we know not; but as it is evident from a passage in the ninth book, that the compliment was paid after the death of Sejanus, and consequently in the most shameful period of Tiberius’s reign, we cannot entertain any high opinion of the independent spirit of Valerius Maximus, who could submit to flatter a tyrant, in the zenith of infamy and detestation. But we cannot ascribe the cause to any delicate artifice, of conveying to Tiberius, indirectly, an admonition to reform his conduct. Such an expedient would have only provoked the severest resentment from his jealousy.——</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">PHAEDRUS was a native of Thrace, and was brought to Rome as a slave.

They are divided into five books, and are not less conspicuous for precision and simplicity of thought, than for purity and elegance of style; conveying moral sentiments with unaffected ease and impressive energy. Phaedrus underwent, for some time, a persecution from Sejanus, who, conscious of his own delinquency, suspected that he was obliquely satirised in the commendations bestowed on virtue by the poet. The work of Phaedrus is one of the latest which have been brought to light since the revival of learning. It remained in obscurity until two hundred years ago, when it was discovered in a library at Rheims.——</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">HYGINUS is said to have been a native of Alexandria, or, according to others, a Spaniard.

He wrote, however, a mythological history, under the title</p>",

He Exhibited Some Combats Of Gladiators, Either In The Amphitheatre Of Taurus , Or In The Septa, With Which He Intermingled Troops Of The Best Pugilists From Campania And Africa. He Did Not Always Preside In Person Upon Those Occasions, But Sometimes Gave A Commission To Magistrates Or Friends To Supply His Place. He Frequently Entertained The People With Stage-plays  Of Various Kinds, And In Several Parts Of The City, And Sometimes By Night, When He Caused The Whole City To Be Lighted. He Likewise Gave Various Things To Be Scrambled For Among The People, And Distributed To Every Man A Basket Of Bread With Other Victuals. Upon This Occasion, He Sent His Own Share To A Roman Knight, Who Was Seated Opposite To Him, And Was Enjoying Himself By Eating Heartily. To A Senator, Who Was Doing The Same, He Sent An Appointment Of Praetor-extraordinary. He Likewise Exhibited A Great Number Of Circensian Games From Morning Until Night; Intermixed With The Hunting Of Wild Beasts From Africa, Or The Trojan Exhibition. Some Of These Games Were Celebrated With Peculiar Circumstances; The Circus Being Overspread With Vermilion And Chrysolite; And None Drove In The Chariot Races Who Were Not Of The Senatorian Order. For Some Of These He Suddenly Gave The Signal, When, Upon His Viewing From The Gelotiana  The Preparations In The Circus, He Was Asked To Do So By A Few Persons In The Neighbouring Galleries.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

For He Made A Bridge, Of About Three Miles And A Half In Length, From Baiae To The Mole Of Puteoli , Collecting Trading Vessels From All Quarters, Mooring Them In Two Rows By Their Anchors, And Spreading Earth Upon Them To Form A Viaduct, After The Fashion Of The Appian Way . This Bridge He Crossed And Recrossed For Two Days Together; The First Day Mounted On A Horse Richly Caparisoned, Wearing On His Head A Crown Of Oak Leaves, Armed With A Battle-axe, A Spanish Buckler And A Sword, And In A Cloak Made Of Cloth Of Gold; The Day Following, In The Habit Of A Charioteer, Standing In A Chariot, Drawn By Two High-bred Horses, Having With Him A Young Boy, Darius By Name, One Of The Parthian Hostages, With A Cohort Of The Pretorian Guards Attending Him, And A  Party Of His Friends In Cars Of Gaulish Make . Most People, I Know, Are Of Opinion, That This Bridge Was Designed By Caius, In Imitation Of Xerxes, Who, To The Astonishment Of The World, Laid A Bridge Over The Hellespont, Which Is Somewhat Narrower Than The Distance Betwixt Baiae And Puteoli. Others, However, Thought That He Did It To Strike Terror In Germany And Britain, Which He Was Upon The Point Of Invading, By The Fame Of Some Prodigious Work. But For Myself, When I Was A Boy, I Heard My Grandfather Say , That The Reason Assigned By Some Courtiers Who Were In Habits Of The Greatest Intimacy With Him, Was This; When Tiberius Was In Some Anxiety About The Nomination Of A Successor, And Rather Inclined To Pitch Upon His Grandson, Thrasyllus The Astrologer Had Assured Him, “That Caius Would No More Be Emperor, Than He Would Ride On Horseback Across The Gulf Of Baiae.”</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

The Walls Of Syracuse, Which Had Fallen To Decay By Length Of Time, He Repaired, As He Likewise Did The Temples Of The Gods. He Formed Plans For Rebuilding The Palace Of Polycrates At Samos, Finishing The Temple Of The Didymaean Apollo At Miletus, And Building A Town On A Ridge Of The Alps; But, Above All, For Cutting Through The Isthmus In Achaia ; And Even Sent A Centurion Of The First Rank To Measure Out The Work.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He ordered all the images of the gods, which were famous either for their beauty, or the veneration paid them, among which was that of Jupiter Olympius, to be brought from Greece, that he might take the heads off, and put on his own. Having continued part of the Palatium as far as the Forum, and the temple of Castor and Pollux being converted into a kind of vestibule to his house, he often stationed himself between the twin brothers, and so presented himself to be worshipped by all votaries; some of whom saluted him by the name of Jupiter Latialis. He also instituted a temple and priests, with choicest victims, in honour of his own divinity. In his temple stood a statue of gold, the exact image of himself, which was daily dressed in garments corresponding with those he wore himself. The most opulent persons in the city offered</p>",
  "page-563": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">themselves as candidates for the honour of being his priests, and purchased it successively at an immense price. The victims were flamingos, peacocks, bustards, guinea-fowls, turkey and pheasant hens, each sacrificed on their respective days. On nights when the moon was full, he was in the constant habit of inviting her to his embraces and his bed. In the day-time he talked in private to Jupiter Capitolinus; one while whispering to him, and another turning his ear to him: sometimes he spoke aloud, and in railing language. For he was overheard to threaten the god thus:</p><p>Hae em’ anaeir’, hae ego se; \nRaise thou me up, or I’ll—</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">until being at last prevailed upon by the entreaties of the god, as he said, to take up his abode with him, he built a bridge over the temple of the Deified Augustus, by which he joined the Palatium to the Capitol.

He Said That His Mother Was The Fruit Of An Incestuous Commerce, Maintained By Augustus With His Daughter Julia. And Not Content With This Vile Reflection Upon The Memory Of Augustus, He Forbad His Victories At Actium, And On The Coast Of Sicily, To Be Celebrated, As Usual; Affirming That They Had Been Most Pernicious And Fatal To The Roman People. He Called His Grandmother Livia Augusta “Ulysses In A Woman’s Dress,” And Had The Indecency To Reflect Upon Her In A Letter To The Senate, As Of Mean Birth, And Descended, By The Mother’s Side, From A Grandfather Who Was Only One Of The Municipal Magistrates Of Fondi; Whereas It Is Certain, From The Public Records, That Aufidius Lurco Held High Offices At Rome. His Grandmother Antonia Desiring A Private Conference With Him, He Refused To Grant It, Unless Macro, The Prefect Of The Pretorian Guards, Were Present. Indignities Of This Kind, And Ill Usage, Were The Cause Of Her Death; But Some Think He Also Gave Her Poison. Nor Did He Pay The Smallest Respect To Her Memory After Her Death, But Witnessed The Burning From His Private Apartment. His Brother Tiberius, Who Had No Expectation Of Any Violence, Was Suddenly Dispatched By A Military Tribune Sent By His Order For That Purpose. He Forced Silanus, His Father-in-law, To Kill Himself, By Cutting His Throat With A Razor. The Pretext He Alleged For These Murders Was, That The Latter Had Not Followed Him Upon His Putting To Sea In Stormy Weather, But Stayed Behind With The View Of Seizing The City, If He Should Perish. The Other, He Said, Smelt Of An Antidote, Which He Had Taken To Prevent His Being Poisoned By Him; Whereas Silanus Was Only Afraid Of Being Sea-sick, And The Disagreeableness Of A Voyage; And Tiberius Had Merely Taken A Medicine For An Habitual Cough,  Which Was Continually Growing Worse.

When She Was Afterwards Married To Cassius Longinus, A Man Of Consular Rank, He Took Her From Him, And Kept Her Constantly As If She Were His Lawful Wife. In A Fit Of Sickness, He By His Will Appointed Her Heiress Both Of His Estate And The Empire. After Her Death, He Ordered A Public Mourning For Her; During Which It Was Capital For Any Person To Laugh, Use The Bath, Or Sup With His Parents, Wife, Or Children. Being Inconsolable Under His Affliction, He Went Hastily, And In The Night-time, From The City; Going Through Campania To Syracuse, And Then Suddenly Returned Without Shaving His Beard, Or Trimming His Hair. Nor Did He Ever Afterwards, In Matters Of The Greatest Importance, Not Even In The Assemblies Of The People Or Before The Soldiers, Swear Any Otherwise, Than “By The Divinity Of Drusilla.” The Rest Of His Sisters He Did Not Treat With So Much Fondness Or Regard; But Frequently Prostituted Them To His Catamites. He Therefore The More Readily Condemned Them In The Case Of Aemilius Lepidus, As Guilty Of Adultery, And Privy To That Conspiracy Against Him. Nor Did He Only Divulge Their Own Hand-writing Relative To The Affair, Which He Procured By Base And Lewd Means, But Likewise Consecrated To Mars The Avenger Three Swords Which Had Been Prepared To Stab Him, With An Inscription, Setting Forth The Occasion Of Their Consecration.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Some Say, That Being Invited To The Wedding-supper, He Sent A Messenger To Piso, Who Sat Opposite To Him, In These Words: “Do Not Be Too Fond With My Wife,” And That He Immediately Carried Her Off. Next Day He Published A Proclamation, Importing, “That He Had Got A Wife As Romulus And Augustus Had Done.”  Lollia Paulina, Who Was Married To A Man Of Consular Rank In Command Of An Army, He Suddenly Called From The Province Where She Was With Her Husband, Upon Mention Being Made That Her Grandmother Was Formerly Very Beautiful, And Married Her; But He Soon Afterwards Parted With Her, Interdicting Her From Having Ever Afterwards Any Commerce With Man. He Loved With A Most Passionate And Constant Affection Caesonia, Who Was Neither Handsome Nor Young; And Was Besides The Mother Of Three Daughters By Another Man; But A Wanton Of Unbounded Lasciviousness. Her He Would Frequently Exhibit To The Soldiers, Dressed In A Military Cloak, With Shield And Helmet, And Riding By His Side. To His Friends He Even Showed Her Naked. After She Had A Child, He Honoured Her With The Title Of Wife; In One And The Same Day, Declaring Himself Her Husband, And Father Of The Child Of Which She Was Delivered. He Named It Julia Drusilla, And Carrying It Round The Temples Of All The Goddesses, Laid It On The Lap Of Minerva; To Whom He Recommended The Care Of Bringing Up And Instructing Her.

Others Of Them, After He Had Privately Put Them To Death, He Nevertheless Continued To Send For, As If They Were Still Alive, And After A Few Days Pretended That They Had Laid Violent Hands Upon Themselves. The Consuls Having Forgotten To Give Public Notice Of His Birth-day, He Displaced Them; And The Republic Was Three Days Without Any One In That High Office. A Quaestor Who Was Said To Be Concerned In A Conspiracy Against Him, He Scourged Severely, Having First Stripped Off His Clothes, And Spread Them Under The Feet Of The Soldiers Employed In The Work, That They Might Stand The More Firm. The Other Orders Likewise He Treated With The Same Insolence And Violence. Being Disturbed By The Noise Of People Taking Their Places At Midnight In The Circus, As They Were To Have Free Admission, He Drove Them All Away With Clubs. In This Tumult, Above Twenty Roman Knights Were Squeezed To Death, With As Many Matrons, With A Great Crowd Besides. When Stage-plays Were Acted, To Occasion Disputes Between The People And The Knights, He Distributed The Money-tickets Sooner Than Usual, That The Seats Assigned To The Knights Might Be All Occupied By The Mob. In The Spectacles Of Gladiators, Sometimes, When The Sun Was Violently Hot, He Would Order The Curtains, Which Covered The Amphitheatre, To Be Drawn Aside , And Forbad Any Person To Be Let Out; Withdrawing At The Same Time The Usual Apparatus For The Entertainment, And Presenting Wild Beasts Almost Pined To Death, The Most Sorry Gladiators, Decrepit With Age, And Fit Only To Work The Machinery, And Decent House-keepers, Who Were Remarkable For Some Bodily Infirmity.

Another, Who Had Vowed To Give His Life For The Same Cause, Having Shrunk From The Sacrifice, He Delivered, Adorned As A Victim, With Garlands And Fillets, To Boys, Who Were To Drive Him Through The Streets, Calling On Him To Fulfil His Vow, Until He Was Thrown Headlong From The Ramparts. After Disfiguring Many Persons Of Honourable Rank, By Branding Them In The Face With Hot Irons, He Condemned Them To The Mines, To Work In Repairing The High-ways, Or To Fight With Wild Beasts; Or Tying Them By The Neck And Heels, In The Manner Of Beasts Carried To Slaughter, Would Shut Them Up In Cages, Or Saw Them Asunder. Nor Were These Severities Merely Inflicted For Crimes Of Great Enormity, But For Making Remarks On His Public Games, Or For Not Having Sworn By The Genius Of The Emperor. He Compelled Parents To Be Present At The Execution Of Their Sons; And To One Who Excused Himself On Account Of Indisposition, He Sent His Own Litter. Another He Invited To His Table Immediately After He Had Witnessed The Spectacle, And Coolly Challenged Him To Jest And Be Merry. He Ordered The Overseer Of The Spectacles And Wild Beasts To Be Scourged In Fetters, During Several Days Successively, In His Own Presence, And Did Not Put Him To Death Until He Was Disgusted With The Stench Of His Putrefied Brain. He Burned Alive, In The Centre Of The Arena Of The Amphitheatre, The Writer Of A Farce, For Some Witty Verse, Which Had A Double Meaning.

Being Very Desirous To Have A Senator Torn To Pieces, He Employed Some Persons To Call Him A Public Enemy, Fall Upon Him As He Entered The Senate-house, Stab Him With Their Styles, And Deliver Him To The Rest To Tear Asunder.

One Of Pretorian Rank Having Sent Several Times From Anticyra , Whither He Had Gone For His Health, To Have His Leave Of Absence Prolonged, He Ordered Him To Be Put To Death; Adding These Words “Bleeding Is Necessary For One That Has Taken Hellebore So Long, And Found No Benefit.” It Was His Custom Every Tenth Day To Sign The Lists Of Prisoners Appointed For Execution; And This He Called “Clearing His Accounts.” And Having Condemned Several Gauls And Greeks At One Time, He Exclaimed In Triumph, “I Have Conquered Gallograecia.”</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Being incensed at the people’s applauding a party at the Circensian games in opposition to him, he exclaimed, “I wish the Roman people had but one neck.”  When Tetrinius, the highwayman, was denounced, he said his persecutors too were all Tetrinius’s. Five Retiarii , in tunics, fighting in a company, yielded without a struggle to the same number of opponents; and being ordered to be slain, one of them taking up his lance again, killed all the conquerors.

At Rome, In A Public Feast, A Slave Having Stolen Some Thin Plates Of Silver With Which The Couches Were Inlaid, He Delivered Him Immediately To An Executioner, With Orders To Cut Off His Hands, And Lead Him Round The Guests, With Them Hanging From His Neck Before His Breast, And A Label, Signifying The Cause Of His Punishment. A Gladiator Who Was Practising With Him, And Voluntarily Threw Himself At His Feet, He Stabbed With A Poniard, And Then Ran About With A Palm Branch In His Hand, After The Manner Of Those Who Are Victorious In The Games.

Impatient Of The Least Delay, He Condemned By A Single Sentence Forty  Persons, Against Whom There Were Different Charges; Boasting To Caesonia When She Awoke, “How Much Business He Had Dispatched While She Was Taking Her Mid-day Sleep.” He Exposed To Sale By Auction, The Remains Of The Apparatus Used In The Public Spectacles; And Exacted Such Biddings, And Raised The Prices So High, That Some Of The Purchasers Were Ruined, And Bled Themselves To Death. There Is A Well-known Story Told Of Aponius Saturninus, Who Happening To Fall Asleep As He Sat On A Bench At The Sale, Caius Called Out To The Auctioneer, Not To Overlook The Praetorian Personage Who Nodded To Him So Often; And Accordingly The Salesman Went On, Pretending To Take The Nods For Tokens Of Assent, Until Thirteen Gladiators Were Knocked Down To Him At The Sum Of Nine Millions Of Sesterces , He Being In Total Ignorance Of What Was Doing.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Amongst the people, the remembrance of Germanicus’ virtues cherished for his family an attachment which was probably, increased by its misfortunes; and they were anxious to see revived in the son the popularity of the</p>",

Since the commencement of the imperial dominion, there never had been any period so favourable for a counter-revolution as the present crisis. There existed now no Livia, to influence the minds of the senate and people in respect of the government; nor was there any other person allied to the family of Germanicus, whose countenance or intrigues could promote the views of Caligula. He himself was now only in the twenty-fifth year of his age, was totally inexperienced in the administration of public affairs, had never performed even the smallest service to his</p>",
  "page-608": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">country, and was generally known to be of a character which  disgraced his illustrious descent. Yet, in spite of all these circumstances, such was the destiny of Rome, that his accession afforded joy to the soldiers, who had known him in his childhood, and to the populace in the capital, as well as the people in the provinces, who were flattered with the delusive expectation of receiving a prince who should adorn the throne with the amiable virtues of Germanicus.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It is difficult to say, whether weakness of understanding, or corruption of morals, were more conspicuous in the character of Caligula. He seems to have discovered from his earliest years an innate depravity of mind, which was undoubtedly much increased by defect of education. He had lost both his parents at an early period of life; and from Tiberius’ own character, as well as his views in training the person who should succeed him on the throne, there is reason</p>",
  "page-609": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to think, that if any attention whatever was paid to the education of Caligula, it was directed to vitiate all his faculties and passions, rather than to correct and improve them. If such was really the object, it was indeed prosecuted with success.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The commencement, however, of his reign was such as by no means prognosticated its subsequent transition. The sudden change of his conduct, the astonishing mixture of imbecility and presumption, of moral turpitude and frantic extravagance, which he afterwards evinced; such as rolling himself over heaps of gold, his treatment of his horse Incitatus, and his design of making him consul, seem to justify a suspicion that his brain had actually been affected, either by the potion, said to have been given him by his wife Caesonia, or otherwise. Philtres, or love-potions, as they were called, were frequent in those times; and the people believed that they operated upon the mind by a</p>",

It is, however, beyond a doubt, that their effects were produced entirely by the action of their physical qualities upon the organs of the body. They were usually made of the satyrion, which, according to Pliny, was a provocative. They were generally given by women to their husbands at bed-time; and it was necessary towards their successful operation, that the parties should sleep together. This circumstance explains the whole mystery. The philtres were nothing more than medicines of a stimulating quality, which, after exciting violent, but temporary effects, enfeebled the constitution, and occasioned nervous disorders, by which the mental faculties, as well as the corporeal, might be injured. That this was really the case with Caligula, seems probable, not only from the falling sickness, to which he was subject, but from the habitual wakefulness of which he complained.</p>",

To supply the extravagance of future years, new and exorbitant taxes were imposed upon the people, and those too on the necessaries of life. There existed now amongst the Romans every motive that could excite a general indignation against the government; yet such was still the dread of imperial power, though vested in the hands of so weak and despicable a sovereign, that no insurrection was attempted, nor any extensive conspiracy formed; but the obnoxious emperor fell at last a sacrifice to a few centurions of his own guard.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This reign was of too short duration to afford any</p>",

Nor did he desist from pursuing them, until an apparition, in the form of a barbarian woman, of more than human size, appeared to him, and, in the Latin tongue, forbad him to proceed any farther. For these achievements he had the honour of an ovation, and the triumphal ornaments. After his praetorship, he immediately entered on the office of consul, and returning again to Germany, died of disease, in the summer encampment, which thence obtained the name of “The Unlucky Camp.” His corpse was carried to Rome by the principal persons of the several municipalities and colonies upon the road, being met and received by the recorders of each place, and buried</p>",

In honour of his  memory, the army erected a monument, round which the soldiers used, annually, upon a certain day, to march in solemn procession, and persons deputed from the several cities of Gaul performed religious rites. The senate likewise, among various other honours, decreed for him a triumphal arch of marble, with trophies, in the Appian Way, and gave the cognomen of Germanicus to him and his posterity. In him the civil and military virtues were equally displayed; for, besides his victories, he gained from the enemy the Spolia Opima , and frequently marked out the German chiefs in the midst of their army, and encountered them in single combat, at the utmost hazard of his life. He likewise often declared that he would, some time or other, if possible, restore the ancient government. In this account, I suppose, some have ventured to affirm that Augustus was jealous of him, and recalled him; and because he made no haste</p>",

This I mention, that I may not be guilty of any omission, more than because I think it either true or probable; since Augustus loved him so much when living, that he always, in his wills, made him joint-heir with his sons, as he once declared in the senate; and upon his decease, extolled him in a speech to the people, to that degree, that he prayed the gods “to make his Caesars like him, and to grant himself as honourable an exit out of this world as they had given him.” And not satisfied with inscribing upon his tomb an epitaph in verse composed by himself, he wrote likewise the history of his life in prose. He had by the younger Antonia several children, but left behind him only three, namely, Germanicus, Livilla, and Claudius.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

He Was Left An Infant By His Father, And During Almost The Whole Of His Minority, And For Some Time After He Attained The Age Of Manhood, Was Afflicted With A Variety Of Obstinate Disorders, Insomuch That His Mind And Body Being Greatly Impaired, He Was, Even After His Arrival At Years Of Maturity, Never Thought Sufficiently Qualified For Any Public Or Private Employment. He Was, Therefore, During A Long Time, And Even After The Expiration Of His Minority, Under The Direction Of A Pedagogue, Who, He Complains In A Certain Memoir, “Was A Barbarous Wretch, And Formerly Superintendent Of The Mule-drivers, Who Was Selected For His Governor, On Purpose To Correct Him Severely On Every Trifling Occasion.” On Account Of This Crazy Constitution Of Body And Mind, At The Spectacle Of Gladiators, Which He Gave The People, Jointly With His Brother, In Honour Of His Father’s Memory, He Presided, Muffled Up In A Pallium—a New Fashion.

His Mother, Antonia, Frequently Called Him “An Abortion Of A Man, That Had Been Only Begun, But Never Finished, By Nature.” And When She Would Upbraid Any One With Dulness, She Said, “He Was A Greater Fool Than Her Son, Claudius.” His Grandmother, Augusta, Always Treated Him With The Utmost Contempt, Very Rarely Spoke To Him, And When She Did Admonish Him Upon Any Occasion, It Was In Writing, Very Briefly And Severely, Or By Messengers. His Sister, Livilla, Upon Hearing That He Was About To Be Created Emperor, Openly And Loudly Expressed Her Indignation That The Roman People Should Experience A Fate So Severe And So Much Below Their Grandeur.

When He Entered The Theatre, They Used To Rise, And Put Off Their Cloaks. The Senate Likewise Decreed, That He Should Be Added To The Number Of The Augustal College Of Priests, Who Were Chosen By Lot; And Soon Afterwards, When His House Was Burnt Down, That It Should Be Rebuilt At The Public Charge; And That He Should Have The Privilege Of Giving His Vote Amongst The Men Of Consular Rank. This Decree Was, However, Repealed; Tiberius Insisting To Have Him Excused On Account Of His Imbecility, And Promising To Make Good His Loss At His Own Expense. But At His Death, He Named Him In His Will, Amongst His Third Heirs, For A Third Part Of His Estate; Leaving Him Besides A Legacy Of Two Millions Of Sesterces, And Expressly Recommending Him To The Armies, The Senate And People Of Rome, Amongst His Other Relations.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

When The Conspiracy Of Lepidus And Gaetulicus Was Discovered, Being Sent With Some Other Deputies Into Germany , To Congratulate The Emperor Upon The Occasion, He Was In Danger Of His Life; Caius Being Greatly Enraged, And Loudly Complaining, That His Uncle Was Sent To Him, As If He Was A Boy Who Wanted A Governor.

A Common Soldier, Who Happened To Pass That Way, Spying His Feet, And Desirous To Discover Who He Was, Pulled Him Out; When Immediately Recognizing Him, He Threw Himself In A Great Fright At His Feet, And Saluted Him By The Title Of Emperor. He Then Conducted Him To His Fellow-soldiers, Who Were All In A Great Rage, And Irresolute What They Should Do. They Put Him Into A Litter, And As The Slaves Of The Palace Had All Fled, Took Their Turns In Carrying Him On Their Shoulders, And Brought Him Into The Camp, Sad And Trembling; The People Who Met Him Lamenting His Situation, As If The Poor Innocent Was Being Carried To Execution. Being Received Within The Ramparts , He Continued All Night With The Sentries On Guard, Recovered Somewhat From His Fright, But In No Great Hopes Of The Succession. For The Consuls, With The Senate And Civic Troops, Had Possessed Themselves Of The Forum And Capitol, With The Determination To Assert The Public Liberty; And He Being Sent For Likewise, By A Tribune Of The People, To The Senate-house, To Give His Advice Upon The Present Juncture Of Affairs, Returned Answer, “I Am Under Constraint, And Cannot Possibly Come.” The Day Afterwards, The Senate Being Dilatory In Their Proceedings, And Worn Out By Divisions Amongst Themselves, While The People Who Surrounded The Senate-house Shouted That They Would Have One Master, Naming Claudius, He Suffered The Soldiers Assembled Under Arms To Swear Allegiance To Him, Promising Them Fifteen Thousand Sesterces A Man; He Being The First Of The Caesars Who Purchased The Submission Of The Soldiers With Money.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Accordingly, He Passed An Act Of Perpetual Oblivion And Pardon For Every Thing Said Or Done During That Time; And This He Faithfully Observed, With The Exception Only Of Putting To Death A Few Tribunes And Centurions Concerned In The Conspiracy Against Caius, Both As An Example, And Because He Understood That They Had Also Planned His Own Death. He Now Turned  His Thoughts Towards Paying Respect To The Memory Of His Relations. His Most Solemn And Usual Oath Was, “By Augustus.” He Prevailed Upon The Senate To Decree Divine Honours To His Grandmother Livia, With A Chariot In The Circensian Procession Drawn By Elephants, As Had Been Appointed For Augustus ; And Public Offerings To The Shades Of His Parents. Besides Which, He Instituted Circensian Games For His Father, To Be Celebrated Every Year, Upon His Birth-day, And, For His Mother, A Chariot To Be Drawn Through The Circus; With The Title Of Augusta, Which Had Been Refused By His Grandmother . To The Memory Of His Brother , To Which, Upon All Occasions, He Showed A Great Regard, He Gave A Greek Comedy, To Be Exhibited In The Public Diversions At Naples , And Awarded The Crown For It, According To The Sentence Of The Judges In That Solemnity. Nor Did He Omit To Make Honourable And Grateful Mention Of Mark Antony; Declaring By A Proclamation, “That He The More Earnestly Insisted Upon The Observation Of His Father Drusus’s Birth-day, Because It Was Likewise That Of His Grandfather Antony.” He Completed The Marble Arch Near Pompey’s Theatre, Which Had Formerly Been Decreed By The Senate In Honour Of Tiberius, But Which Had Been Neglected .

When The Tribunes Of The People Came To Him While He Was On The Tribunal, He Excused Himself, Because, On Account Of The Crowd, He Could Not Hear Them Unless They Stood. In A Short Time, By This Conduct, He Wrought Himself So Much Into The Favour And Affection Of The Public, That When, Upon His Going To Ostia, A Report Was Spread In The City That He Had Been Way-laid And Slain, The People Never Ceased Cursing The Soldiers For Traitors, And The Senate As Parricides, Until One Or Two Persons, And Presently After Several Others, Were Brought By The Magistrates Upon The Rostra, Who Assured Them That He Was Alive, And Not Far From The City, On His Way Home.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Whether He Was Consul Or Out Of Office, He Constantly Attended The Courts For The Administration Of Justice, Even Upon Such Days As Were Solemnly Observed As Days Of Rejoicing In His Family, Or By His Friends; And Sometimes Upon The Public Festivals Of Ancient Institution.

For Where Persons Lost Their Suits By Insisting Upon More Than Appeared To Be Their Due, Before The Judges Of Private Causes, He Granted Them The Indulgence Of A Second Trial.

Another Who Was Summoned Before Him In A Cause Of His Own, But Alleged That The Affair Did Not Properly Come Under The  Call Him Back, As He Was Quitting The Tribunal, But Would Seize Him By The Lap Of His Coat, And Sometimes Catch Him By The Heels, To Make Him Stay. That Such Behaviour, However Strange, Is Not Incredible, Will Appear From This Anecdote. Some Obscure Greek, Who Was A Litigant, Had An Altercation With Him, In Which He Called Out, “You Are An Old Fool.”  It Is Certain That A Roman Knight, Who Was Prosecuted By An Impotent Device Of His Enemies On A False Charge Of Abominable Obscenity With Women, Observing That Common Strumpets Were Summoned Against Him And Allowed To Give Evidence, Upbraided Claudius In Very Harsh And Severe Terms With His Folly And Cruelty, And Threw His Style, And Some Books Which He Had In His Hands, In His Face, With Such Violence As To Wound Him Severely In The Cheek.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Nor In This Review Did He Suffer Any One To Give An Account Of His Conduct By An Advocate, But Obliged Each Man To Speak For Himself In The Best Way He Could. He Disgraced Many, And Some That Little Expected It, And For A Reason Entirely New, Namely, For Going Out Of Italy Without His License;  And One Likewise, For Having In His Province Been The Familiar Companion Of A King; Observing, That, In Former Times, Rabirius Posthumus Had Been Prosecuted For Treason, Although He Only Went After Ptolemy To Alexandria For The Purpose Of Securing Payment Of A Debt . Having Tried To Brand With Disgrace Several Others, He, To His Own Greater Shame, Found Them Generally Innocent, Through The Negligence Of The Persons Employed To Inquire Into Their Characters; Those Whom He Charged With Living In Celibacy, With Want Of Children, Or Estate, Proving Themselves To Be Husbands, Parents, And In Affluent Circumstances. One Of The Knights Who Was Charged With Stabbing Himself, Laid His Bosom Bare, To Show That There Was Not The Least Mark Of Violence Upon His Body. The Following Incidents Were Remarkable In His Censorship. He Ordered A Car, Plated With Silver, And Of Very Sumptuous Workmanship, Which Was Exposed For Sale In The Sigillaria , To Be Purchased, And Broken In Pieces Before His Eyes. He Published Twenty Proclamations In One Day, In One Of Which He Advised The People, “Since The Vintage Was Very Plentiful, To Have Their Casks Well Secured At The Bung With Pitch:” And In Another, He Told Them, “That Nothing Would Sooner Cure The Bite Of A Viper, Than The Sap Of The Yew-tree.”</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Therefore Used All Possible Means To Bring Provisions To The City, Even In The Winter. He Proposed To The Merchants A Sure Profit, By Indemnifying Them Against Any Loss That Might Befall Them By Storms At Sea; And Granted Great Privileges To Those Who Built Ships For That Traffic. To A Citizen Of Rome He Gave An Exemption From The Penalty Of The Papia-poppaean Law ; To One Who Had Only The Privilege Of Latium, The Freedom Of The City; And To Women The Rights Which By Law Belonged To Those Who Had Four Children: Which Enactments Are In Force To This Day.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

He Brought To The City The Cool And Plentiful Springs Of The Claudian Water, One Of Which Is Called Caeruleus, And The Other Curtius And Albudinus, As Likewise The River Of The New Anio, In A Stone Canal; And Distributed Them Into Many Magnificent Reservoirs. The Canal From The Fucine Lake Was Undertaken As Much For The Sake Of Profit, As For The Honour Of The Enterprise; For There Were Parties Who Offered To Drain It At Their Own Expense, On Condition Of Their Having A Grant Of The Land Laid Dry. With Great Difficulty He Completed A Canal Three Miles In Length, Partly By Cutting Through, And Partly By Tunnelling, A Mountain; Thirty Thousand Men Being Constantly Employed In The Work For Eleven Years . He Formed The Harbour At Ostia, By Carrying Out Circular Piers On The Right And On The Left, With  A Mole Protecting, In Deep Water, The Entrance Of The Port . To Secure The Foundation Of This Mole, He Sunk The Vessel In Which The Great Obelisk  Had Been Brought From Egypt ; And Built Upon Piles A Very Lofty Tower, In Imitation Of The Pharos At Alexandria, On Which Lights Were Burnt To Direct Mariners In The Night.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

In The Games Which He Presented At The Dedication Of Pompey’s Theatre , Which Had Been Burnt Down, And Was Rebuilt By Him, He Presided Upon A Tribunal Erected For Him In The Orchestra; Having First Paid His Devotions, In The Temple Above, And Then Coming Down Through The Centre Of The Circle, While All The People Kept Their Seats In Profound Silence . He Likewise  Joined By The Common People, Count Upon His Fingers Aloud The Gold Pieces Presented To Those Who Came Off Conquerors. He Would Earnestly Invite The Company To Be Merry; Sometimes Calling Them His “Masters,” With A Mixture Of Insipid, Far-fetched Jests. Thus, When The People Called For Palumbus , He Said, “He Would Give Them One When He Could Catch It.” The Following Was Well-intended, And Well-timed; Having, Amidst Great Applause, Spared A Gladiator, On The Intercession Of His Four Sons, He Sent A Billet Immediately Round The Theatre, To Remind The People, “How Much It Behoved Them To Get Children, Since They Had Before Them An Example How Useful They Had Been In Procuring Favour And Security For A Gladiator.” He Likewise Represented In The Campus Martius, The Assault And Sacking Of A Town, And The Surrender Of The British Kings , Presiding In His General’s Cloak. Immediately Before He Drew Off The Waters From The Fucine Lake, He Exhibited Upon It A Naval Fight. But The Combatants On Board The Fleets Crying Out, “Health Attend You, Noble Emperor! We, Who Are About To Peril Our Lives, Salute You;” And He Replying, “Health Attend You Too,” They All Refused To Fight, As If By That Response He Had Meant To Excuse Them. Upon This, He Hesitated For A Time, Whether He Should Not Destroy Them All With Fire And Sword. At Last, Leaping From His Seat, And Running Along The Shore Of The Lake With Tottering Steps, The Result Of His Foul Excesses, He, Partly By Fair Words, And Partly By Threats, Persuaded Them To Engage. This Spectacle Represented An Engagement Between The Fleets Of Sicily And Rhodes; Consisting Each Of Twelve Ships Of War, Of Three Banks Of Oars.

But Being Ensnared By The Arts Of Agrippina,  The Daughter Of His Brother Germanicus, Who Took Advantage Of The Kisses And Endearments Which Their Near Relationship Admitted, To Inflame His Desires, He Got Some One To Propose At The Next Meeting Of The Senate, That They Should Oblige The Emperor To Marry Agrippina, As A Measure Highly Conducive To The Public Interest; And That In Future Liberty Should Be Given For Such Marriages, Which Until That Time Had Been Considered Incestuous.

Not yet in possession of the public treasury, which perhaps was exhausted, he could not immediately reward the services of his electors with a pecuniary gratification; but he promised them a largess of fifteen thousand sesterces a man, upwards of a hundred and forty pounds sterling; and as we meet with no account of any subsequent discontents in the army, we may justly conclude that the promise was soon after fulfilled. This transaction laid the foundation of that military despotism, which, through many succeeding ages, convulsed the Roman empire.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Besides the interposition of the soldiers upon this occasion, it appears that the populace of Rome were extremely clamorous for the government of a single person, and for that of Claudius in particular. This partiality for a monarchical government proceeded from two causes. The commonalty, from their obscure</p>",
  "page-669": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">situation, were always the least exposed to oppression, under a tyrannical prince. They had likewise ever been remarkably fond of stage-plays and public shows, with which, as well as with scrambles, and donations of bread and other victuals, the preceding emperor had frequently gratified them. They had therefore less to fear, and more to hope, from the government of a single person than any other class of Roman citizens. With regard to the partiality for Claudius, it may be accounted for partly from the low habits of life to which he had been addicted, in consequence of which many of them were familiarly acquainted with him; and this circumstance likewise increased their hope of deriving some advantage from his accession. Exclusive of all these considerations, it is highly probable that the populace were instigated in favour of Claudius by the artifices of his freedmen, persons of mean extraction, by whom he was afterwards entirely governed, and who,</p>",
  "page-670": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">upon such an occasion, would exert their utmost efforts to procure his appointment to the throne. From the debate in the senate having continued during  two days, it was evident that there was still a strong party for restoring the ancient form of government. That they were in the end overawed by the clamour of the multitude, is not surprising, when we consider that the senate was totally unprovided with resources of every kind for asserting the independence of the nation by arms; and the commonalty, who interrupted their deliberations, were the only people by whose assistance they ever could effect the restitution of public freedom. To this may be added, that the senate, by the total reduction of their political importance, ever since the overthrow of the republic, had lost both the influence and authority which they formerly enjoyed. The extreme cruelty, likewise, which had been exercised during the last two reigns, afforded a further motive for</p>",
  "page-671": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">relinquishing all attempts in favour of liberty, as they might be severely revenged upon themselves by the subsequent emperor: and it was a degree of moderation in Claudius, which palliates the injustice of his cause, that he began his government with an act of amnesty respecting the public transactions which ensued upon the death of Caligula.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Claudius, at the time of his accession, was fifty years of age; and though he had hitherto lived apparently unambitious of public honours, accompanied with great ostentation, yet he was now seized with a desire to enjoy a triumph. As there existed no war, in which he might perform some military achievement, his vanity could only be gratified by invading a foreign country, where, contrary to the advice contained in the testament of Augustus, he might attempt to extend still further the limits of the empire. Either Britain, therefore, or some nation on the continent, at a great</p>",
  "page-672": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">distance from the capital, became the object of such an enterprize; and the former was chosen, not only as more convenient, from its vicinity to the maritime province of Gaul, but on account of a remonstrance lately presented by the Britons to the court of Rome, respecting the protection afforded to some persons of that nation, who had fled thither to elude the laws of their country. Considering the state of Britain at that time, divided as it was into a number of principalities, amongst which there was no general confederacy for mutual defence, and where the alarm excited by the invasion of Julius Caesar, upwards of eighty years before, had long since been forgotten; a sudden attempt upon the island could not fail to be attended with success. Accordingly, an army was sent over, under the command of Aulus Plautius, an able general, who defeated the natives in several engagements, and penetrated a considerable way into the country.</p>",
  "page-673": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Preparations for the emperor’s voyage now being made, Claudius set sail from Ostia, at the mouth of  the Tiber; but meeting with a violent storm in the Mediterranean, he landed at Marseilles, and proceeding thence to Boulogne in Picardy, passed over into Britain. In what part he debarked, is uncertain, but it seems to have been at some place on the south-east coast of the island. He immediately received the submission of several British states, the Cantii, Atrebates, Regni, and Trinobantes, who inhabited those parts; and returning to Rome, after an absence of six months, celebrated with great pomp the triumph, for which he had undertaken the expedition.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the interior parts of Britain, the natives, under the command of Caractacus, maintained an obstinate resistance, and little progress was made by the Roman arms, until Ostorius Scapula was sent over to prosecute the war.

  "page-674": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">warlike tribe, who inhabited the banks of the Severn; and having defeated Caractacus in a great battle, made him prisoner, and sent him to Rome. The fame of the British prince had by this time spread over the provinces of Gaul and Italy; and upon his arrival in the Roman capital, the people flocked from all quarters to behold him. The ceremonial of his entrance was conducted with great solemnity. On a plain adjoining the Roman camp, the pretorian troops were drawn up in martial array: the emperor and his court took their station in front of the lines, and behind them was ranged the whole body of the people. The procession commenced with the different trophies which had been taken from the Britons during the progress of the war. Next followed the brothers of the vanquished prince, with his wife and daughter, in chains, expressing by their supplicating looks and gestures the fears with which they were actuated. But not so Caractacus himself.</p>",
  "page-675": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">With a manly gait and an undaunted countenance, he marched up to the tribunal, where the emperor was seated, and addressed him in the following terms:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“If to my high birth and distinguished rank, I had added the virtues of moderation, Rome had beheld me rather as a friend than a captive; and you would not have rejected an alliance with a prince, descended from illustrious ancestors, and governing many nations. The reverse of my fortune to you is glorious, and to me humiliating. I had arms, and men, and horses; I possessed extraordinary riches; and can it be any wonder that I was unwilling to lose them? Because Rome aspires to universal dominion, must men therefore implicitly resign themselves to subjection? I opposed for a long time the progress of your arms, and had I acted otherwise, would either you have had the glory of conquest, or I of a brave resistance? I am now in your  power: if you are determined to take revenge, my fate</p>",
  "page-676": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">will soon be forgotten, and you will derive no honour from the transaction. Preserve my life, and I shall remain to the latest ages a monument of your clemency.”</p><p>Immediately upon this speech, Claudius granted him his liberty, as he did likewise to the other royal captives. They all returned their thanks in a manner the most grateful to the emperor; and as soon as their chains were taken off, walking towards Agrippina, who sat upon a bench at a little distance, they repeated to her the same fervent declarations of gratitude and esteem.</p><p>History has preserved no account of Caractacus after this period; but it is probable, that he returned in a short time to his own country, where his former valour, and the magnanimity, which he had displayed at Rome, would continue to render him illustrious through life, even amidst the irretrievable ruin of his fortunes.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The most extraordinary character in the present</p>",
  "page-677": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">reign was that of Valeria Messalina, the daughter of Valerius Messala Barbatus. She was married to Claudius, and had by him a son and a daughter. To cruelty in the prosecution of her purposes, she added the most abandoned incontinence. Not confining her licentiousness within the limits of the palace, where she committed the most shameful excesses, she prostituted her person in the common stews, and even in the public streets of the capital. As if her conduct was already not sufficiently scandalous, she obliged C. Silius, a man of consular rank, to divorce his wife, that she might procure his company entirely to herself. Not contented with this indulgence to her criminal passion, she next persuaded him to marry her; and during an excursion which the emperor made to Ostia, the ceremony of marriage was actually performed between them. The occasion was celebrated with a magnificent supper, to which she invited a large company; and lest the whole</p>",
  "page-678": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">should be regarded as a frolic, not meant to be consummated, the adulterous parties ascended the nuptial couch in the presence of the astonished spectators. Great as was the facility of Claudius’s temper in respect of her former behaviour, he could not overlook so flagrant a violation both of public decency and the laws of the country. Silius was condemned to death for the adultery which he had perpetrated with reluctance; and Messalina was ordered into the emperor’s presence, to answer for her conduct. Terror now operating upon her mind in conjunction with remorse, she could not summon the resolution to support such an interview, but retired into the gardens of Lucullus, there to indulge at last the compunction which she felt for her crimes, and to meditate the entreaties by which she should endeavour to soothe the resentment  of her husband. In the extremity of her distress, she attempted to lay violent hands upon</p>",
  "page-679": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">herself, but her courage was not equal to the emergency. Her mother, Lepida, who had not spoken with her for some years before, was present upon the occasion, and urged her to the act which alone could put a period to her infamy and wretchedness. Again she made an effort, but again her resolution abandoned her; when a tribune burst into the gardens, and plunging his sword into her body, she instantly expired. Thus perished a woman, the scandal of whose lewdness resounded throughout the empire, and of whom a great satirist, then living, has said, perhaps without a hyperbole,</p><p>Et lassata viris, necdum satiata, recessit.—Juvenal, Sat. VI.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It has been already observed, that Claudius was entirely governed by his freedmen; a class of retainers which enjoyed a great share of favour and confidence with their patrons in those times. They had before been the slaves of their masters, and had obtained their</p>",
  "page-680": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">freedom as a reward for their faithful and attentive services. Of the esteem in which they were often held, we meet with an instance in Tiro, the freedman of Cicero, to whom that illustrious Roman addresses several epistles, written in the most familiar and affectionate strain of friendship. As it was common for them to be taught the more useful parts of education in the families of their masters, they were usually well qualified for the management of domestic concerns, and might even be competent to the superior departments of the state, especially in those times when negotiations and treaties with foreign princes seldom or never occurred; and in arbitrary governments, where public affairs were directed more by the will of the sovereign or his ministers, than by refined suggestions of policy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">From the character generally given of Claudius before his elevation to the throne, we should not readily</p>",

Besides history, Suetonius informs us that he wrote a Defence of Cicero against the Charges of Asinius Gallus. This appears to be the only tribute of esteem or approbation paid to the character of Cicero, from the time of Livy the historian, to the extinction of the race of the Caesars. Asinius Gallus was the son of Asinius Pollio, the orator. Marrying Vipsania after she had been divorced by Tiberius, he incurred the displeasure of that emperor, and died of famine, either voluntarily, or by order of the tyrant. He wrote a comparison between his father and Cicero, in which, with more filial partiality than justice, he gave the preference to the former.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

Lamenting Once, Among His Fellow-pupils, The Case Of A Charioteer Of The Green Party, Who Was Dragged Round The Circus At The Tail Of His Chariot, And Being Reprimanded By His Tutor For It, He Pretended That He Was Talking Of Hector. In The Beginning Of His Reign, He Used To Amuse Himself Daily With Chariots Drawn By Four Horses, Made Of Ivory, Upon A Table. He Attended At All The Lesser Exhibitions In The Circus, At First Privately, But At Last Openly; So That Nobody Ever Doubted Of His Presence On Any Particular Day. Nor Did He Conceal His Desire To Have The Number Of The Prizes Doubled; So That The Races Being Increased Accordingly, The Diversion Continued Until A Late Hour; The Leaders Of Parties Refusing Now To Bring Out Their Companies For Any Time Less Than The Whole Day. Upon This, He Took A Fancy For Driving The Chariot Himself, And That Even Publicly. Having Made His First Experiment In The Gardens, Amidst Crowds Of Slaves And Other Rabble, He At Length Performed In The View Of All The People, In The Circus Maximus, Whilst One Of His Freedmen Dropped The Napkin In The Place Where The Magistrates Used To Give The Signal. Not Satisfied With Exhibiting Various Specimens Of His Skill In Those Arts At Rome, He Went Over To Achaia, As Has Been Already Said, Principally For This Purpose. The Several Cities, In Which Solemn Trials Of Musical Skill Used To Be Publicly Held, Had Resolved To Send Him The Crowns Belonging To Those Who Bore Away The Prize. These He Accepted So Graciously, That He Not Only Gave The Deputies Who Brought Them An Immediate Audience, But Even Invited Them To His Table. Being Requested By Some Of Them To Sing At Supper, And Prodigiously Applauded, He Said, “The Greeks Were The Only People Who Has An Ear For Music, And Were The Only Good Judges Of Him And His Attainments.” Without Delay He Commenced His Journey, And On His Arrival At Cassiope ,  Exhibited His First Musical Performance Before The Altar Of Jupiter Cassius.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

At Olympia, Likewise, Contrary To Custom, He Appointed A Public Performance In Music: And That He Might Meet With No Interruption In This Employment, When He Was Informed By His Freedman Helius, That Affairs At Rome Required His Presence, He Wrote To Him In These Words: “Though Now All Your Hopes And Wishes Are For My Speedy Return, Yet You Ought Rather To Advise And Hope That I May Come Back With A Character Worthy Of Nero.” During The Time Of His Musical Performance, Nobody Was Allowed To Stir Out Of The Theatre Upon Any Account, However Necessary; Insomuch, That It Is Said Some Women With Child Were Delivered There. Many Of The Spectators Being Quite Wearied With Hearing And Applauding Him, Because The Town Gates Were Shut, Slipped Privately Over The Walls; Or Counterfeiting Themselves Dead, Were Carried Out For Their Funeral. With What Extreme Anxiety He Engaged In These Contests, With What Keen Desire To Bear Away The Prize, And With How Much Awe Of The Judges, Is Scarcely To Be Believed. As If His Adversaries Had Been On A Level With Himself, He Would Watch Them Narrowly, Defame Them Privately, And Sometimes, Upon Meeting Them, Rail At Them In Very Scurrilous Language; Or Bribe Them, If They Were Better Performers Than Himself. He Always Addressed The Judges With The Most Profound Reverence Before He Began, Telling Them, “He Had Done All Things That Were Necessary, By Way Of Preparation, But That The Issue Of The Approaching Trial Was In The Hand Of Fortune; And That They, As Wise And Skilful Men, Ought To Exclude From Their Judgment Things Merely Accidental.” Upon Their Encouraging Him To Have A Good Heart, He Went Off With More Assurance, But Not Entirely Free From Anxiety; Interpreting The Silence And Modesty Of Some Of Them Into Sourness And Ill-nature, And Saying That He Was Suspicious Of Them.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

When The Prize Was Adjudged To Him, He Always Proclaimed It Himself; And Even Entered The Lists With The Heralds. That No Memory Or The Least Monument Might Remain Of Any Other Victor In The Sacred Grecian Games, He Ordered All Their Statues And Pictures To Be Pulled Down, Dragged Away With Hooks, And Thrown Into The Common Sewers. He Drove The Chariot With Various Numbers Of Horses, And At The Olympic Games With No Fewer Than Ten; Though, In A Poem Of His, He Had Reflected Upon Mithridates For That Innovation. Being Thrown Out Of His Chariot, He Was Again Replaced, But Could Not Retain His Seat, And Was Obliged To Give Up, Before He Reached The Goal, But Was Crowned Notwithstanding. On His Departure, He Declared The Whole Province A Free Country, And Conferred Upon The Judges In The Several Games The Freedom Of Rome, With Large Sums Of Money.

In The Same Manner He Entered Antium, Alba, And Rome. He Made His Entry Into The City Riding In The Same Chariot In Which Augustus Had Triumphed, In A Purple Tunic, And A Cloak Embroidered With Golden Stars, Having On His Head The Crown Won At Olympia, And In His Right Hand That Which Was Given Him At The Parthian Games: The Rest Being Carried In A Procession Before Him, With Inscriptions Denoting The Places Where They Had Been Won, From Whom, And In What Plays Or Musical Performances; Whilst A Train Followed Him With Loud Acclamations, Crying Out, That “They  Open Enmity To Many, According As They Were Lavish Or Sparing In Giving Him Their Applause.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

After It Was Dark, He Used To Enter The Taverns Disguised In A Cap Or A Wig, And Ramble About The Streets In Sport, Which Was Not Void Of Mischief. He Used To Beat Those He Met Coming Home From Supper; And, If They Made Any Resistance, Would Wound Them, And Throw Them Into The Common Sewer. He Broke Open And Robbed Shops; Establishing An Auction At Home For Selling His Booty. In The Scuffles Which Took Place On Those Occasions, He Often Ran The Hazard Of Losing His Eyes, And Even His Life; Being Beaten Almost To Death By A Senator, For Handling His Wife Indecently. After This Adventure, He Never Again Ventured Abroad At That Time Of Night, Without Some Tribunes Following Him At A Little Distance. In The Day-time He Would Be Carried To The Theatre Incognito In A Litter, Placing Himself Upon The Upper Part Of The Proscenium, Where He Not Only Witnessed The Quarrels Which Arose On Account Of The Performances, But Also Encouraged Them.

He Completed His Palace By Continuing It From The Palatine To The Esquiline Hill, Calling The Building At First Only “The Passage,” But, After It Was Burnt Down And Rebuilt, “The Golden House.”  Of Its Dimensions And Furniture, It May Be Sufficient To Say Thus Much: The Porch Was So High That There Stood In It A Colossal Statue Of Himself A Hundred And Twenty Feet In Height; And The Space Included In It Was So Ample, That It Had Triple Porticos A Mile In Length, And A Lake Like A Sea, Surrounded With Buildings Which Had The Appearance Of A City. Within Its Area Were Corn Fields, Vineyards, Pastures, And Woods, Containing A Vast Number Of Animals Of Various Kinds, Both Wild And Tame. In Other Parts It Was Entirely Over-laid With Gold, And Adorned With Jewels And Mother Of Pearl. The Supper Rooms Were Vaulted, And Compartments Of The Ceilings, Inlaid With Ivory, Were Made To Revolve, And Scatter Flowers; While They Contained Pipes Which  Shed Unguents Upon The Guests. The Chief Banqueting Room Was Circular, And Revolved Perpetually, Night And Day, In Imitation Of The Motion Of The Celestial Bodies. The Baths Were Supplied With Water From The Sea And The Albula.

The Length Of The Proposed Canal Was One Hundred And Sixty Miles; And It Was Intended To Be Of Breadth Sufficient To Permit Ships With Five Banks Of Oars To Pass Each Other. For The Execution Of These Designs, He Ordered All Prisoners, In Every Part Of The Empire, To Be Brought To Italy; And That Even Those Who Were Convicted Of The Most Heinous Crimes, In Lieu Of Any Other Sentence, Should Be Condemned To Work At Them. He Was Encouraged To All This Wild And Enormous Profusion, Not Only By The Great Revenue Of The Empire, But By The Sudden Hopes Given Him Of An Immense Hidden Treasure, Which Queen Dido, Upon Her Flight From Tyre, Had Brought With Her To Africa.

In The First Place, He Ordered, That If Any Freedman, Without Sufficient Reason, Bore The Name Of The Family To Which He Belonged; The Half, Instead Of Three Fourths, Of His Estate Should Be Brought Into The Exchequer At His Decease: Also That The Estates Of All Such Persons As Had Not In Their Wills Been Mindful Of Their Prince, Should Be Confiscated; And That The Lawyers Who Had Drawn Or Dictated Such Wills, Should Be Liable To A Fine. He Ordained Likewise, That All Words And Actions, Upon Which Any Informer Could Ground A Prosecution, Should Be Deemed Treason.

Having Forbad Any One To Use The Colours Of Amethyst And Tyrian Purple, He Privately Sent A Person To Sell A Few Ounces Of Them Upon The Day Of The Nundinae, And Then Shut Up All The Merchants’ Shops, On The Pretext That His Edict Had Been Violated.

He Never Nominated A Person To Any Office Without Saying To Him, “You Know What I Want; And Let Us Take Care That Nobody Has Any Thing He Can Call His Own.” At Last He Rifled Many Temples Of The Rich Offerings With Which They Were Stored, And Melted Down All The Gold And Silver Statues, And Amongst Them Those Of The Penates , Which Galba Afterwards Restored.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

The Children Of Those Who Had Been Condemned, Were Banished The City, And Afterwards Either Poisoned Or Starved To Death.

The Charge Against Cassius Longinus, A Lawyer Who Had Lost His Sight, Was, That He Kept Amongst The Busts Of His Ancestors That Of Caius Cassius, Who Was Concerned In The Death Of Julius Caesar. The Only Charge Objected Against Paetus Thrasea Was, That He Had A Melancholy Cast Of Features, And Looked Like A Schoolmaster.

Besides Claudius, she projected the death of L. Silanus, and she accomplished that of his brother, Junius Silanus, by means likewise of poison. She appears to have been richly endowed with the gifts of nature, but in her disposition intriguing, violent, imperious, and ready to sacrifice every principle of virtue, in the pursuit of supreme power or sensual gratification.

The island of Mona, now Anglesey, being the chief seat of the Druids, he resolved to commence his operations with attacking a place which was the centre of superstition, and to which the vanquished Britons retreated as the last asylum of liberty. The inhabitants endeavoured, both by force of arms and the terrors of religion, to obstruct his landing on this sacred island. The women and Druids assembled promiscuously with the soldiers upon the shore, where running about in wild disorder, with flaming torches in their hands, and pouring forth the most hideous exclamations, they struck the Romans with</p>",

But Suetonius animating his troops, they boldly attacked the inhabitants, routed them in the field, and burned the Druids in the same fires which had been prepared by those priests for the catastrophe of the invaders, destroying at the same time all the consecrated groves and altars in the island. Suetonius having thus triumphed over the religion of the Britons, flattered himself with the hopes of soon effecting the reduction of the people. But they, encouraged by his absence, had taken arms, and under the conduct of Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, who had been treated in the most ignominious manner by the Roman tribunes, had already driven the hateful invaders from their several settlements. Suetonius hastened to  the protection of London, which was by this time a flourishing Roman colony; but he found upon his arrival, that any attempt to preserve it would be attended with the utmost danger to the army.

This massacre, however, was revenged by Suetonius in a decisive engagement, where eighty thousand of the Britons are said to have been killed; after which, Boadicea, to avoid falling into the hands of the insolent conquerors, put a period to her own life by means of poison. It being judged unadvisable that Suetonius should any longer conduct the war against a people whom he had exasperated by his severity, he was recalled, and Petronius Turpilianus appointed in his room.

The despotism of Julius Caesar, though haughty and imperious, was liberal and humane: that of Augustus, if we exclude a few instances of vindictive severity towards individuals, was mild and conciliating; but the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero , while discriminated from each other by some peculiar circumstances, exhibited the most flagrant acts of licentiousness and perverted authority. The most abominable lust, the most</p>",
  "page-762": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">extravagant luxury, the most shameful rapaciousness, and the most inhuman cruelty, constitute the general characteristics of those capricious and detestable tyrants. Repeated experience now clearly refuted the opinion of Augustus, that he had introduced amongst the Romans the best form of government: but while we make this observation, it is proper to remark, that, had he even restored the republic, there is reason to believe that the nation would again have been soon distracted with internal divisions, and a perpetual succession of civil wars. The manners of the people were become too dissolute to be restrained by the authority of elective and temporary magistrates; and the Romans were hastening to that fatal period when general and great corruption, with its attendant debility, would render them an easy prey to any foreign invaders.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But the odious government of the emperors was not the only grievance under which the people laboured in</p>",
  "page-763": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">those disastrous times: patrician avarice concurred with imperial rapacity to increase the sufferings of the nation. The senators, even during the commonwealth, had become openly corrupt in the dispensation of public justice; and under the government of the emperors pernicious abuse was practised to a yet greater extent. That class being now, equally with other Roman citizens, dependent on the sovereign power, their sentiments of duty and  honour were degraded by the loss of their former dignity; and being likewise deprived of the lucrative governments of provinces, to which they had annually succeeded by an elective rotation in the times of the republic, they endeavoured to compensate the reduction of their emoluments by an unbounded venality in the judicial decisions of the forum. Every source of national happiness and prosperity was by this means destroyed. The possession of property became precarious; industry, in all its</p>",
  "page-764": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">branches, was effectually discouraged, and the amor patriae, which had formerly been the animating principle of the nation, was almost universally extinguished.</p><p>It is a circumstance corresponding to the general singularity of the present reign, that, of the few writers who flourished in it, and whose works have been transmitted to posterity, two ended their days by the order of the emperor, and the third, from indignation at his conduct. These unfortunate victims were Seneca, Petronius Arbiter, and Lucan.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">SENECA was born about six years before the Christian aera, and gave early indication of uncommon talents. His father, who had come from Corduba to Rome, was a man of letters, particularly fond of declamation, in which he instructed his son, and placed him, for the acquisition of philosophy, under the most celebrated stoics of that age. Young Seneca, imbibing</p>",
  "page-765": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the precepts of the Pythagorean doctrine, religiously abstained from eating the flesh of animals, until Tiberius having threatened to punish some Jews and Egyptians, who abstained from certain meats, he was persuaded by his father to renounce the Pythagorean practice. Seneca displayed the talents of an eloquent speaker; but dreading the jealousy of Caligula, who aspired to the same excellence, he thought proper to abandon that pursuit, and apply himself towards suing for the honours and offices of the state. He accordingly obtained the place of quaestor, in which office incurring the imputation of a scandalous amour with Julia Livia, he removed from Rome, and was banished by the emperor Claudius to Corsica.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Upon the marriage of Claudius with Agrippina, Seneca was recalled from his exile, in which he had remained near eight years, and was appointed to superintend the education of Nero, now destined to</p>",
  "page-766": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">become the successor to the throne. In the character of preceptor he appears to have acquitted himself with ability and credit; though he has been charged by his enemies with having initiated his pupil in those detestable vices which disgraced the reign of Nero. Could he have indeed been guilty of such immoral conduct, it is probable that he would not so easily have  forfeited the favour of that emperor; and it is more reasonable to suppose, that his disapprobation of Nero’s conduct was the real cause of that odium which soon after proved fatal to him. By the enemies whom distinguished merit and virtue never fail to excite at a profligate court, Seneca was accused of having maintained a criminal correspondence with Agrippina in the life-time of Claudius; but the chief author of this calumny was Suilius, who had been banished from Rome at the instance of Seneca. He was likewise charged with having amassed exorbitant riches, with</p>",
  "page-767": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">having built magnificent houses, and formed beautiful gardens, during the four years in which he had acted as preceptor to Nero. This charge he considered as a prelude to his destruction; which to avoid, if possible, he requested of the emperor to accept of the riches and possessions which he had acquired in his situation at court, and to permit him to withdraw himself into a life of studious retirement. Nero, dissembling his secret intentions, refused this request; and Seneca, that he might obviate all cause of suspicion or offence, kept himself at home for some time, under the pretext of indisposition.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Upon the breaking out of the conspiracy of Piso, in which some of the principal senators were concerned, Natalis, the discoverer of the plot, mentioned Seneca’s name, as an accessory. There is, however, no satisfactory evidence that Seneca had any knowledge of the plot. Piso, according to the declaration of Natalis, had</p>",
  "page-768": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">complained that he never saw Seneca; and the latter had observed, in answer, that it was not conducive to their common interest to see each other often. Seneca likewise pleaded indisposition, and said that his own life depended upon the safety of Piso’s person. Nero, however, glad of such an occasion of sacrificing the philosopher to his secret jealousy, sent him an order to destroy himself. When the messenger arrived with this mandate, Seneca was sitting at table, with his wife Paulina and two of his friends. He heard the message not only with philosophical firmness, but even with symptoms of joy, and observed, that such an honour might long have been expected from a man who had assassinated all his friends, and even murdered his own mother. The only request which he made, was, that he might be permitted to dispose of his possessions as he pleased; but this was refused him. Immediately turning himself to his friends, who were weeping at his</p>",
  "page-769": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">melancholy fate, he said to them, that, since he could not leave them what he considered as his own property, he should leave at least his own life for an example; an innocence of conduct which they might imitate, and by which they might acquire immortal fame. He remonstrated with composure against their unavailing tears and  lamentations, and asked them, whether they had not learnt better to sustain the shocks of fortune, and the violence of tyranny?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The emotions of his wife he endeavoured to allay with philosophical consolation; and when she expressed a resolution to die with him, he said, that he was glad to find his example imitated with so much fortitude. The veins of both were opened at the same time; but Nero’s command extending only to Seneca, the life of Paulina was preserved; and, according to some authors, she was not displeased at being prevented from carrying her precipitate resolution into effect. Seneca’s veins</p>",

To accelerate his lingering fate, he drank a dose of poison; but this producing no effect, he ordered his attendants to carry him into a warm bath, for the purpose of rendering the haemorrhage from his veins more copious. This expedient proving likewise ineffectual, and the soldiers who witnessed the execution of the emperor’s order being clamorous for its accomplishment, he was removed into a stove, and suffocated by the steam. He underwent his fate on the 12th of April, in the sixty-fifth year of the Christian aera, and the fifty-third year of his age. His body was burnt, and his ashes deposited in a private manner, according to his will, which had been made during the period when he was in the</p>",
  "page-771": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">highest degree of favour with Nero.</p><p>The writings of Seneca are numerous, and on various subjects. His first composition, addressed to Novacus, is on Anger, and continued through three books. After giving a lively description of this passion, the author discusses a variety of questions concerning it: he argues strongly against its utility, in contradiction to the peripatetics, and recommends its restraint, by many just and excellent considerations. This treatise may be regarded, in its general outlines, as a philosophical amplification of the passage in Horace:—</p><p>Ira furor brevis est: animum rege; qui, nisi paret,\nImperat: hunc fraenis, hunc tu compesce catena.\nEpist. I. ii.</p><p>Anger’s a fitful madness: rein thy mind,\nSubdue the tyrant, and in fetters bind,\nOr be thyself the slave.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The next treatise is on Consolation, addressed to his mother, Helvia, and was written during his exile. He</p>",
  "page-772": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">there informs his mother that he bears his banishment with fortitude, and advises her to do the same. He observes, that, in respect to himself,  change of place, poverty, ignominy, and contempt, are not real evils; that there may be two reasons for her anxiety on his account; first, that, by his absence, she is deprived of his protection; and in the next place, of the satisfaction arising from his company; on both which heads he suggests a variety of pertinent observations. Prefixed to this treatise, are some epigrams written on the banishment of Seneca, but whether or not by himself, is uncertain.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Immediately subsequent to the preceding, is another treatise on Consolation, addressed to one of Claudius’s freedmen, named Polybius, perhaps after the learned historian. In this tract, which is in several parts mutilated, the author endeavours to console Polybius for the loss of a brother who had lately died. The</p>",
  "page-773": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sentiments and admonitions are well suggested for the purpose; but they are intermixed with such fulsome encomiums on the imperial domestic, as degrade the dignity of the author, and can be ascribed to no other motive than that of endeavouring to procure a recall from his exile, through the interest of Polybius.</p><p>A fourth treatise on Consolation is addressed to Marcia, a respectable and opulent lady, the daughter of Cremutius Cordus, by whose death she was deeply affected. The author, besides many consolatory arguments, proposes for her imitation a number of examples, by attending to which she may be enabled to overcome a passion that is founded only in too great sensibility of mind. The subject is ingeniously prosecuted, not without the occasional mixture of some delicate flattery, suitable to the character of the correspondent.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">These consolatory addresses are followed by a</p>",
  "page-774": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">treatise on Providence, which evinces the author to have entertained the most just and philosophical sentiments on that subject. He infers the necessary existence of a Providence from the regularity and constancy observed in the government of the universe but his chief object is to show, why, upon the principle that a Providence exists, good men should be liable to evils. The enquiry is conducted with a variety of just observations, and great force of argument; by which the author vindicates the goodness and wisdom of the Almighty, in a strain of sentiment corresponding to the most approved suggestions of natural religion.</p><p>The next treatise, which is on Tranquillity of Mind, appears to have been written soon after his return from exile. There is a confusion in the arrangement of this tract; but it contains a variety of just observations, and may be regarded as a valuable production.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Then follows a discourse on the Constancy of a</p>",
  "page-775": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Wise Man. This has by some been considered as a part of the preceding treatise; but they are evidently distinct. It is one of the author’s best productions, in regard both of sentiment and composition, and contains a fund of moral observations, suited to fortify the mind under the oppression of accidental calamities.</p><p>We next meet with a tract on Clemency, in two books, addressed to Nero. This appears to have been written in the beginning of the reign of Nero, on whom the author bestows some high encomiums, which, at that time, seem not to have been destitute of foundation. The discourse abounds with just observation, applicable to all ranks of men; and, if properly attended to by that infatuated emperor, might have prevented the perpetration of those acts of cruelty, which, with his other extravagancies, have rendered his name odious to posterity.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The discourse which succeeds is on the Shortness of</p>",
  "page-776": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Life, addressed to Paulinus. In this excellent treatise the author endeavours to show, that the complaint of the shortness of life is not founded in truth: that it is men who make life short, either by passing it in indolence, or otherwise improperly. He inveighs against indolence, luxury, and every unprofitable avocation; observing, that the best use of time is to apply it to the study of wisdom, by which life may be rendered sufficiently long.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Next follows a discourse on a Happy Life, addressed to Gallio. Seneca seems to have intended this as a vindication of himself, against those who calumniated him on account of his riches and manner of living. He maintained that a life can only be rendered happy by its conformity to the dictates of virtue, but that such a life is perfectly compatible with the possession of riches, where they happen to accrue. The author pleads his own cause with great ability, as well as justness of</p>",
  "page-777": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">argument. His vindication is in many parts highly beautiful, and accompanied with admirable sentiments respecting the moral obligations to a virtuous life. The conclusion of this discourse bears no similarity, in point of composition, to the preceding parts, and is evidently spurious.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The preceding discourse is followed by one upon the Retirement of a Wise Man. The beginning of this tract is wanting; but in the sequel the author discusses a question which was much agitated amongst the Stoics and Epicureans, viz., whether a wise man ought to concern himself with the affairs of the public. Both these sects of philosophers maintained that a life of retirement was most suitable to a wise man, but they differed with respect to the circumstances in which it might be proper to deviate from this conduct; one party considering the deviation  as prudent, when there existed a just motive for such conduct, and the other,</p>",
  "page-778": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">when there was no forcible reason against it. Seneca regards both these opinions as founded upon principles inadequate to the advancement both of public and private happiness, which ought ever to be the ultimate object of moral speculation.</p><p>The last of the author’s discourses, addressed to Aebucius, is on Benefits, and continued through seven books. He begins with lamenting the frequency of ingratitude amongst mankind, a vice which he severely censures. After some preliminary considerations respecting the nature of benefits, he proceeds to show in what manner, and on whom, they ought to be conferred. The greater part of these books is employed on the solution of abstract questions relative to benefits, in the manner of Chrysippus; where the author states explicitly the arguments on both sides, and from the full consideration of them, deduces rational conclusions.</p>",
  "page-779": "<p>The Epistles of Seneca consist of one hundred and twenty-four, all on moral subjects. His Natural Questions extend through seven books, in which he has collected the hypotheses of Aristotle and other ancient writers. These are followed by a whimsical effusion on the death of Caligula. The remainder of his works comprises seven Persuasive Discourses, five books of Controversies, and ten books containing Extracts of Declamations.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">From the multiplicity of Seneca’s productions, it is evident, that, notwithstanding the luxurious life he is said to have led, he was greatly devoted to literature, a propensity which, it is probable, was confirmed by his banishment during almost eight years in the island of Corsica, where he was in a great degree secluded from every other resource of amusement to a cultivated mind. But with whatever splendour Seneca’s domestic economy may have been supported, it seems highly</p>",
  "page-780": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">improbable that he indulged himself in luxurious enjoyment to any vicious excess. His situation at the Roman court, being honourable and important, could not fail of being likewise advantageous, not only from the imperial profusion common at that time, but from many contingent emoluments which his extensive interest and patronage would naturally afford him. He was born of a respectable rank, lived in habits of familiar intercourse with persons of the first distinction, and if, in the course of his attendance upon Nero, he had acquired a large fortune, no blame could justly attach to his conduct in maintaining an elegant hospitality. The imputation of luxury was thrown upon him from two quarters, viz, by the dissolute companions of Nero, to whom the mention of such an example served as an apology for their own extreme dissipation;  and by those who envied him for the affluence and dignity which he had acquired. The</p>",
  "page-781": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">charge, however, is supported only by vague assertion, and is discredited by every consideration which ought to have weight in determining the reality of human characters. It seems totally inconsistent with his habits of literary industry, with the virtuous sentiments which he every where strenuously maintains, and the esteem with which he was regarded by a numerous acquaintance, as a philosopher and a moralist.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The writings of Seneca have been traduced almost equally with his manner of living, though in both he has a claim to indulgence, from the fashion of the times. He is more studious of minute embellishments in style than the writers of the Augustan age; and the didactic strain, in which he mostly prosecutes his subjects, has a tendency to render him sententious; but the expression of his thoughts is neither enfeebled by decoration, nor involved in obscurity by conciseness. He is not more rich in artificial ornament than in moral admonition.</p>",
  "page-782": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Seneca has been charged with depreciating former writers, to render himself more conspicuous; a charge which, so far as appears from his writings, is founded rather in negative than positive testimony. He has not endeavoured to establish his fame by any affectation of singularity in doctrine; and while he passes over in silence the names of illustrious authors, he avails himself with judgment of the most valuable stores with which they had enriched philosophy. On the whole, he is an author whose principles may be adopted not only with safety, but great advantage; and his writings merit a degree of consideration, superior to what they have hitherto ever enjoyed in the literary world.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Seneca, besides his prose works, was the author of some tragedies.

After this transaction, to deprive Petronius of all means of justifying himself, they threw into prison the greatest part of his</p>",
  "page-784": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">domestics. Nero embraced with joy the opportunity of removing a man, to whom he knew the present manners of the court were utterly obnoxious, and he soon after issued orders for arresting Petronius. As it required, however, some time to deliberate whether they should put a person of his consideration to death, without more evident proofs of the charges preferred against him, such was his disgust at living in the power of so detestable and capricious a tyrant, that he resolved to die. For this purpose, making choice of the same expedient which had been adopted by Seneca, he caused his veins to be opened, but he closed them again, for a little time, that he might enjoy the conversation of his friends, who came to see him in his last moments. He desired them, it is said, to entertain him, not with discourses on the immortality of the soul, or the consolation of philosophy, but with agreeable tales and poetic gallantries. Disdaining to imitate the servility of</p>",
  "page-785": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">those who, dying by the orders of Nero, yet made him their heir, and filled their wills with encomiums on the tyrant and his favourites, he broke to pieces a goblet of precious stones, out of which he had commonly drank, that Nero, who he knew would seize upon it after his death, might not have the pleasure of using it. As the only present suitable to such a prince, he sent him, under a sealed cover, his Satyricon, written purposely against him; and then broke his signet, that it might not, after his death, become the means of accusation against the person in whose custody it should be found.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Satyricon of Petronius is one of the most curious productions in the Latin language. Novel in its nature, and without any parallel in the works of antiquity, some have imagined it to be a spurious composition, fabricated about the time of the revival of learning in Europe. This conjecture, however, is not more destitute of support, than repugnant to the most</p>",
  "page-786": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">circumstantial evidence in favour of its authenticity. Others, admitting the work to be a production of the age of Nero, have questioned the design with which it was written, and have consequently imputed to the author a most immoral intention. Some of the scenes, incidents, and characters, are of so extraordinary a nature, that the description of them, without a particular application, must have been regarded as extremely whimsical, and the work, notwithstanding its ingenuity, has been doomed to perpetual oblivion: but history justifies the belief, that in the court of Nero, the extravagancies mentioned by Petronius were realized  to a degree which authenticates the representation given of them. The inimitable character of Trimalchio, which exhibits a person sunk in the most debauched effeminacy, was drawn for Nero; and we are assured, that there were formerly medals of that emperor, with these words, C. Nero August. Imp., and on the reverse,</p>",
  "page-787": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Trimalchio. The various characters are well discriminated, and supported with admirable propriety. Never was such licentiousness of description united to such delicacy of colouring. The force of the satire consists not in poignancy of sentiment, but in the ridicule which arises from the whimsical, but characteristic and faithful exhibition of the objects introduced. That Nero was struck with the justness of the representation, is evident from the displeasure which he showed, at finding Petronius so well acquainted with his infamous excesses. After levelling his suspicion on all who could possibly have betrayed him, he at last fixed on a senator’s wife, named Silia, who bore a part in his revels, and was an intimate friend of Petronius upon which she was immediately sent into banishment. Amongst the miscellaneous materials in this work, are some pieces of poetry, written in an elegant taste. A poem on the civil war between Caesar</p>",

Barbarism in  language, and a corruption of taste, were the natural consequences of this practice, while the judgment of the multitude was either blind or venal, and while public approbation sanctioned the crudities of hasty composition. There arose, however, in this period, some candidates for the bays, who carried their efforts beyond the narrow limits which custom and inadequate genius prescribed to the poetical exertions of</p>",

Prompted by the desire of displaying his political abilities, he had the imprudence to engage in a competition with his imperial patron. The subject chosen by Nero was the tragical fate of Niobe; and that of Lucan was Orpheus.

In the description of scenes, and the recital of heroic actions, the author discovers a strong and lively imagination; while, in those parts of the work which are addressed either to the understanding or the passions, he is bold, figurative, and animated. Indulging too much in amplification, he is apt to tire with prolixity; but in all his excursions he is ardent, elevated, impressive, and often brilliant.

The last satire of Persius is directed against avarice.

It Was Also Their Constant Custom To Plant Others On The Same Spot, Immediately After A Triumph; And It Was Observed That, A Little Before The Death Of Each Prince, The Tree Which Had Been Set By Him Died Away. But In The Last Year Of Nero, The Whole Plantation Of Laurels Perished To The Very Roots, And The Hens All Died.

Some Are Of Opinion, That It Was Because He Set Fire To A City In Spain, After He Had A Long Time Attacked It To No Purpose, With Torches Dipped In The Gum Called Galbanum: Others Said He Was So Named, Because, In A Lingering Disease, He Made Use Of It As A Remedy, Wrapped Up In Wool: Others, On Account Of His Being Prodigiously Corpulent, Such A One Being Called, In The Language Of The Gauls, Galba; Or, On The Contrary, Because He Was Of A Slender Habit Of Body, Like Those Insects Which Breed In A Sort Of Oak, And Are Called Galbae. Sergius Galba, A Person Of Consular Rank , And The Most Eloquent Man Of His Time, Gave A Lustre To The Family.

Upon Her Pressing Her Suit, He Took An Opportunity, When They Were Alone, Of Stripping Off His Toga, And Showing Her The Deformity Of His Person, That He Might Not Be Thought To Impose Upon Her.

Being Adopted By His Step-mother , He Assumed The Name Of Livius, With The Cognomen Of Ocella, And Changed His Praenomen; For He Afterwards Used That Of Lucius, Instead Of Sergius, Until He Arrived At The Imperial Dignity. It Is Well Known, That When He Came Once, Amongst Other Boys Of His Own Age, To Pay His Respects To Augustus, The Latter, Pinching His Cheek, Said To Him, “And Thou, Child, Too, Wilt Taste Our Imperial Dignity.” Tiberius, Likewise, Being Told That He Would Come To Be Emperor, But At An Advanced Age, Exclaimed, “Let Him Live, Then, Since That Does Not Concern Me!” When His Grandfather Was Offering Sacrifice To  Avert Some Ill Omen From Lightning, The Entrails Of The Victim Were Snatched Out Of His Hand By An Eagle, And Carried Off Into An Oak-tree Loaded With Acorns. Upon This, The Soothsayers Said, That The Family Would Come To Be Masters Of The Empire, But Not Until Many Years Had Elapsed: At Which He, Smiling, Said, “Ay, When A Mule Comes To Bear A Foal.” When Galba First Declared Against Nero, Nothing Gave Him So Much Confidence Of Success, As A Mule’s Happening At That Time To Have A Foal. And Whilst All Others Were Shocked At The Occurrence, As A Most Inauspicious Prodigy, He Alone Regarded It As A Most Fortunate Omen, Calling To Mind The Sacrifice And Saying Of His Grandfather. When He Took Upon Him The Manly Habit, He Dreamt That The Goddess Fortune Said To Him, “I Stand Before Your Door Weary; And Unless I Am Speedily Admitted, I Shall Fall Into The Hands Of The First Who Comes To Seize Me.” On His Awaking, When The Door Of The House Was Opened, He Found A Brazen Statue Of The Goddess, Above A Cubit Long, Close To The Threshold, Which He Carried With Slim To Tusculum, Where He Used To Pass The Summer Season; And Having Consecrated It In An Apartment Of His House, He Ever After Worshipped It With A Monthly Sacrifice, And An Anniversary Vigil.

In Every Town Through Which He Passed In His Way From Spain To Rome, Victims Were Slain On The Right And Left Of The Roads; And One Of These, Which Was A Bull, Being Maddened With The Stroke Of The Axe, Broke The Rope With Which It Was Tied, And Running Straight Against His Chariot, With His Fore-feet Elevated, Bespattered Him With Blood. Likewise, As He Was Alighting, One Of The Guard, Being Pushed Forward By The Crowd, Had Very Nearly Wounded Him With His Lance. And Upon His Entering The City And, Afterwards, The Palace, He Was Welcomed With An Earthquake, And A Noise Like The Bellowing Of Cattle. These Signs Of Ill-fortune Were Followed By Some That Were Still More Apparently Such. Out Of All His Treasures He Had Selected A Necklace Of Pearls And Jewels, To Adorn His Statue Of Fortune At Tusculum. But It Suddenly Occurring To Him That It Deserved A More August Place, He Consecrated It To The Capitoline Venus; And Next Night, He Dreamt That Fortune Appeared To Him, Complaining That She Had Been Defrauded Of The Present Intended Her, And Threatening To Resume What She Had Given Him. Terrified At This Denunciation, At Break Of Day He Sent Forward Some Persons To Tusculum, To Make Preparations For A Sacrifice Which Might Avert The Displeasure Of The Goddess; And When He Himself Arrived At The Place, He Found Nothing But Some Hot Embers Upon The Altar, And An Old Man In Black Standing By, Holding A Little Incense In A Glass, And Some Wine In An Earthern Pot. It Was Remarked, Too, That Whilst He Was Sacrificing Upon The Calends Of January, The Chaplet Fell From His Head, And Upon His Consulting The Pullets For Omens, They Flew Away. Farther, Upon The Day Of His Adopting Piso, When He Was To Harangue The Soldiers, The Seat Which He Used Upon Those Occasions, Through The Neglect Of His Attendants, Was Not Placed, According To Custom, Upon His Tribunal; And In The Senate-house, His Curule Chair Was Set With The Back Forward.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Soon After, He Was Informed, That Otho Was In Possession Of The Pretorian Camp. And Though Most Of His Friends Advised Him To Repair Thither Immediately,  In Hopes That He Might Quell The Tumult By His Authority And Presence, He Resolved To Do Nothing More Than Keep Close Within The Palace, And Secure Himself By Guards Of The Legionary Soldiers, Who Were Quartered In Different Parts About The City. He Put On A Linen Coat Of Mail, However, Remarking At The Same Time, That It Would Avail Him Little Against The Points Of So Many Swords. But Being Tempted Out By False Reports, Which The Conspirators Had Purposely Spread To Induce Him To Venture Abroad—some Few Of Those About Him Too Hastily Assuring Him That The Tumult Had Ceased, The Mutineers Were Apprehended, And The Rest Coming To Congratulate Him, Resolved To Continue Firm In Their Obedience—he Went Forward To Meet Them With So Much Confidence, That Upon A Soldier’s Boasting That He Had Killed Otho, He Asked Him, “By What Authority?” And Proceeded As Far As The Forum.

And To Leave No Artifice Untried To Secure The Favour Of Claudius, Who Was Entirely Governed By His Wives And Freedmen, He Requested As The Greatest Favour From Messalina, That She Would Be Pleased To Let Him Take Off Her Shoes; Which, When He Had Done, He Took Her Right Shoe, And Wore It Constantly Betwixt His Toga And His Tunic, And From Time To Time Covered It With Kisses.

Such Was The Want Of Discipline, And The Licentiousness Both In His Family And Army, That, Not Satisfied With The Provision Every Where Made For Them At The Public Expense, They Committed Every Kind Of Robbery And Insult Upon The Inhabitants, Setting Slaves At Liberty As They Pleased; And If Any Dared To Make Resistance, They Dealt Blows And Abuse, Frequently Wounds, And Sometimes Slaughter Amongst Them.

There Were No Persons He Was More Severe Against Than Jugglers And Astrologers; And As Soon As Any One Of Them Was Informed Against, He Put Him To Death Without The Formality Of A Trial.

In Order, Therefore, To Secure The Favour And Affection Of The People, Vitellius Lavished On All Around Whatever He Had It In His Power To Bestow, Both Publicly And Privately, In The Most Extravagant Manner.

Of The Life Of This Author, Biographers Have Transmitted No Particulars; But We May Place His Birth In The Reign Of Tiberius, Before All The Writers Who Flourished In The Augustan Age Were Extinct. He Enjoyed The Rays Of The Setting Sun Which Had Illumined That Glorious Period, And He Discovers The Efforts Of An Ambition To Recall Its Meridian Splendour. As The Poem Was Left  Incomplete By The Death Of The Author, We Can Only Judge Imperfectly Of The Conduct And General Consistency Of The Fable: But The Most Difficult Part Having Been Executed, Without Any Room For The Censure Of Candid Criticism, We May Presume That The Sequel Would Have Been Finished With An Equal Claim To Indulgence, If Not To Applause. The Traditional Anecdotes Relative To The Argonautic Expedition Are Introduced With Propriety, And Embellished With The Graces Of Poetical Fiction. In Describing Scenes Of Tenderness, This Author Is Happily Pathetic, And In The Heat Of Combat, Proportionably Animated. His Similes Present The Imagination With Beautiful Imagery, And Not Only Illustrate, But Give Additional Force To The Subject. We Find In Flaccus A Few Expressions Not Countenanced By The Authority Of The Most Celebrated Latin Writers. His Language, However, In General, Is Pure; But His Words Are Perhaps Not Always The Best That Might Have Been Chosen.

Accordingly, he applied all the ornaments of his palaces to the decoration of the temples, and purposes of public utility, and appointed several men of the equestrian order to superintend the work. For the relief of the people during the plague, he employed, in the way of sacrifice and medicine, all means both human and divine.

The assiduity with which he applied himself to the collection of information, either curious or useful, surpasses all example. From an early hour in the morning, until late at night, he was almost constantly employed in discharging the duties of his public station, in reading or hearing books read by his amanuensis, and in extracting from them whatever seemed worthy of notice.

The books which he wrote, in consequence of this indefatigable exertion, were, according to the account transmitted by his nephew, Pliny the younger, numerous, and on various subjects. The catalogue of them is as follows: a book on Equestrian Archery, which discovered much skill in the art; the Life of Q. Pomponius Secundus; twenty books of the Wars of Germany; a complete treatise on the Education of an Orator, in six volumes; eight books of Doubtful Discourses, written in the latter part of the reign of Nero, when every kind of moral discussion was attended with danger; with a hundred and sixty volumes of remarks on the writings of the various</p>",

Natural knowledge can only be brought to perfection by the prosecution of enquiries in different climates, and by a communication of discoveries amongst those by whom it is cultivated.

Their notions, however, as might be expected, on a subject so incomprehensible, are vague, confused, and imperfect.

The Day After, He Scattered Among The People A Variety Of Cakes And Other Delicacies To Be Scrambled For; And On The Greater Part Of Them Falling Amidst The Seats Of The Crowd, He Ordered Five Hundred Tickets To Be Thrown Into Each Range Of Benches Belonging To The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

After Several Battles With The Catti And Daci, He Celebrated A Double Triumph. But For His Successes Against The Sarmatians, He Only Bore In Procession The Laurel Crown To Jupiter Capitolinus. The Civil War, Begun By Lucius Antonius, Governor Of Upper Germany, He Quelled, Without Being Obliged To Be Personally Present At It, With Remarkable Good Fortune. For, At The Very Moment Of Joining Battle, The Rhine Suddenly Thawing, The Troops Of The Barbarians Which Were Ready To Join L. Antonius, Were Prevented From Crossing The River. Of This Victory He Had Notice By Some Presages, Before The Messengers Who Brought The News Of It Arrived. For Upon The Very Day The Battle Was Fought, A Splendid Eagle Spread Its Wings Round His Statue At Rome, Making Most Joyful Cries.

But He Did Not Persist In The Execution Of This Project. Some Of The Greatest Offices He Conferred Upon His Freedmen And Soldiers. He Forbad Two Legions To Be Quartered In The Same Camp, And More Than A Thousand Sesterces To Be Deposited By Any Soldier With The Standards; Because It Was Thought That Lucius Antonius Had Been Encouraged In His Late Project By The Large Sum Deposited In The Military Chest By The Two Legions Which He Had In The Same Winter-quarters.

He Occasionally Cautioned The Judges Of The Court Of Recovery To Beware Of Being Too Ready To Admit Claims For Freedom Brought Before Them. He Set A Mark Of Infamy Upon Judges Who Were Convicted Of Taking Bribes, As Well As Upon Their Assessors. He Likewise Instigated The Tribunes Of The People To Prosecute A Corrupt Aedile For Extortion, And To Desire The Senate To Appoint Judges For His Trial. He Likewise Took Such Effectual Care In Punishing Magistrates Of The City, And Governors Of Provinces, Guilty Of Malversation, That They Never Were At Any Time More Moderate Or More Just. Most Of These, Since His Reign, We Have Seen Prosecuted For Crimes Of Various Kinds.

He Expelled A Man Of Quaestorian Rank From The Senate, For Practising Mimicry And Dancing. He Debarred Infamous Women The Use Of Litters; As Also The Right Of Receiving Legacies, Or Inheriting Estates. He Struck Out Of The List Of Judges A Roman Knight For Taking Again His Wife Whom He Had Divorced And Prosecuted For Adultery. He Condemned Several Men Of The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders, Upon The Scantinian Law . The Lewdness Of The Vestal Virgins, Which Had Been Overlooked By His Father And Brother, He Punished Severely, But In Different Ways; Viz. Offences Committed Before His Reign, With Death, And Those Since Its Commencement, According To Ancient Custom.

The secretaries of the quaestors having engaged in trade, according to custom, but contrary to  the Clodian law , he pardoned them for what was past.

In This Number Were, Civica Cerealis, When He Was Proconsul In Africa, Salvidienus Orfitus, And Acilius Glabrio In Exile, Under The Pretence Of Their Planning To Revolt Against Him.

Have You A Mind To Marry?” Salvius Cocceianus Was Condemned To Death For Keeping The Birth-day Of His Uncle Otho, The Emperor: Metius Pomposianus, Because He Was Commonly Reported To Have An Imperial Nativity , And To Carry About With  Him A Map Of The World Upon Vellum, With The Speeches Of Kings And Generals Extracted Out Of Titus Livius; And For Giving His Slaves The Names Of Mago And Hannibal; Sallustius Lucullus, Lieutenant In Britain, For Suffering Some Lances Of A New Invention To Be Called “Lucullean;” And Junius Rusticus, For Publishing A Treatise In Praise Of Paetus Thrasea And Helvidius Priscus, And Calling Them Both “Most Upright Men.” Upon This Occasion, He Likewise Banished All The Philosophers From The City And Italy. He Put To Death The Younger Helvidius, For Writing A Farce, In Which, Under The Character Of Paris And Oenone, He Reflected Upon His Having Divorced His Wife; And Also Flavius Sabinus, One Of His Cousins, Because, Upon His Being Chosen At The Consular Election To That Office, The Public Crier Had, By A Blunder, Proclaimed Him To The People Not Consul, But Emperor.

It Is Certain, That Only Two Of Any Note Were Pardoned, A Tribune Who Wore The Narrow Stripe, And A Centurion; Who, To Clear Themselves From The Charge Of Being Concerned In Any Rebellious Project, Proved Themselves To Have Been Guilty Of Prostitution, And Consequently Incapable Of Exercising Any Influence Either Over The General Or The Soldiers.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

With Equal Arrogance, When He Dictated The Form Of A Letter To Be Used By His Procurators, He Began It Thus: “Our Lord And God Commands So And So;” Whence It Became A Rule That No One Should  Style Him Otherwise Either In Writing Or Speaking.

Nevertheless, He Suddenly Put Him To Death Upon Some Very Slight Suspicion , Almost Before He Was Well Out Of His Consulship. By This Violent Act He Very Much Hastened His Own Destruction. During Eight Months Together There Was So Much Lightning At Rome, And Such Accounts Of The Phaenomenon Were Brought From Other Parts, That At Last He Cried Out, “Let Him Now Strike Whom He Will.” The Capitol Was Struck By Lightning, As Well As The Temple Of The Flavian Family, With The Palatine-house, And His Own Bed-chamber.

The encouragement, however, which the first Vespasian had shown to literature, continued to operate during the present reign; and we behold the first fruits of its auspicious influence in the valuable treatise of QUINTILIAN.</p>",
  "page-969": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Of the life of this celebrated writer, little is known upon any authority that has a title to much credit. We learn, however, that he was the son of a lawyer in the service of some of the preceding emperors, and was born in Rome, though in what consulship, or under what emperor, it is impossible to determine. He married a woman of a noble family, by whom he had two sons. The mother died in the flower of her age, and the sons, at the distance of some time from each other, when their father was advanced in years. The precise time of Quintilian’s own death is equally inauthenticated with that of his birth; nor can we rely upon an author of suspicious veracity, who says that he passed the latter part of his life in a state of indigence which was alleviated by the liberality of his pupil, Pliny the Younger. Quintilian opened a school of rhetoric at Rome, where he not only discharged that labourious employment with great applause,  during more than</p>",
  "page-970": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">twenty years, but pleaded at the bar, and was the first who obtained a salary from the state, for executing the office of a public teacher. He was also appointed by Domitian preceptor to the two young princes who were intended to succeed him on the throne.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">After his retirement from the situation of a teacher, Quintilian devoted his attention to the study of literature, and composed a treatise on the Causes of the Corruption of Eloquence. At the earnest solicitation of his friends, he was afterwards induced to undertake his Institutiones Oratoriae, the most elaborate system of oratory extant in any language. This work is divided into twelve books, in which the author treats with great precision of the qualities of a perfect orator; explaining not only the fundamental principles of eloquence, as connected with the constitution of the human mind, but pointing out, both by argument and observation, the most successful method of exercising that admirable</p>",
  "page-971": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">art, for the accomplishment of its purpose. So minutely, and upon so extensive a plan, has he prosecuted the subject, that he delineates the education suitable to a perfect orator, from the stage of infancy in the cradle, to the consummation of rhetorical fame, in the pursuits of the bar, or those, in general, of any public assembly. It is sufficient to say, that in the execution of this elaborate work, Quintilian has called to the assistance of his own acute and comprehensive understanding, the profound penetration of Aristotle, the exquisite graces of Cicero; all the stores of observation, experience, and practice; and in a word, the whole accumulated exertions of ancient genius on the subject of oratory.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It may justly be regarded as an extraordinary circumstance in the progress of scientific improvement, that the endowments of a perfect orator were never fully exhibited to the world, until it had become dangerous to exercise them for the important purposes</p>",
  "page-972": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">for which they were originally cultivated. And it is no less remarkable, that, under all the violence and caprice of imperial despotism which the Romans had now experienced, their sensibility to the enjoyment of poetical compositions remained still unabated; as if it served to console the nation for the irretrievable loss of public liberty. From this source of entertainment, they reaped more pleasure during the present reign, than they had done since the time of Augustus. The poets of this period were Juvenal, Statius, and Martial.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">JUVENAL was born at Aquinum, but in what year is uncertain; though, from some circumstances, it seems to have been in the reign of Augustus. Some say that he was the son of a freedman,  while others, without specifying the condition of his father, relate only that he was brought up by a freedman. He came at an early age to Rome, where he declaimed for many years, and, pleaded causes in the forum with great applause; but at</p>",
  "page-973": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">last he betook himself to the writing of satires, in which he acquired great fame. One of the first, and the most constant object of is satire, was the pantomime Paris, the great favourite of the emperor Nero, and afterwards of Domitian. During the reign of the former of these emperors, no resentment was shown towards the poet; but he experienced not the same impunity after the accession of the latter; when, to remove him from the capital, he was sent as governor to the frontiers of Egypt, but in reality, into an honourable exile. According to some authors, he died of chagrin in that province: but this is not authenticated, and seems to be a mistake: for in some of Martial’s epigrams, which appear to have been written after the death of Domitian, Juvenal is spoken of as residing at Rome. It is said that he lived to upwards of eighty years of age.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The remaining compositions of this author are sixteen satires, all written against the dissipation and</p>",
  "page-974": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">enormous vices which prevailed at Rome in his time. The various objects of animadversion are painted in the strongest colours, and placed in the most conspicuous points of view. Giving loose reins to just and moral indignation, Juvenal is every where animated, vehement, petulant, and incessantly acrimonious. Disdaining the more lenient modes of correction, or despairing of their success, he neither adopts the raillery of Horace, nor the derision of Persius, but prosecutes vice and folly with all the severity of sentiment, passion, and expression. He sometimes exhibits a mixture of humour with his invectives; but it is a humour which partakes more of virulent rage than of pleasantry; broad, hostile, but coarse, and rivalling in indelicacy the profligate manners which it assails. The satires of Juvenal abound in philosophical apophthegms; and, where they are not sullied by obscene description, are supported with a uniform air of virtuous elevation.</p>",
  "page-975": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Amidst all the intemperance of sarcasm, his numbers are harmonious. Had his zeal permitted him to direct the current of his impetuous genius into the channel of ridicule, and endeavour to put to shame the vices and follies of those licentious times, as much as he perhaps exasperated conviction rather than excited contrition, he would have carried satire to the highest possible pitch, both of literary excellence and moral utility. With every abatement of attainable perfection, we hesitate not to place him at the head of this arduous department of poetry.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Of STATIUS no farther particulars are preserved than that he  was born at Naples; that his father’s name was Statius of Epirus, and his mother’s Agelina, and that he died about the end of the first century of the Christian era.

The works of Statius now extant, are two poems, viz. the Thebais and the Achilleis, besides a collection, named Silvae.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The Thebais consists of twelve books, and the subject of it is the Theban war, which happened 1236 years before the Christian era, in consequence of a dispute between Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of Oedipus and Jocasta. These brothers had entered into an agreement with each other to reign alternately for a year at a time; and Eteocles being the elder, got first possession of the throne. This prince refusing to abdicate at the expiration of the year, Polynices fled to Argos, where marrying Argia, the daughter of Adrastus, king of that country, he procured the assistance of his father-in-law, to enforce the engagement stipulated with his brother Eteocles. The Argives marched under the command of seven able generals, who were to attack separately the seven gates of Thebes. After much blood</p>",
  "page-977": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">had been spilt without any effect, it was at last agreed between the two parties, that the brothers should determine the dispute by single combat. In the desperate engagement which ensued, they both fell; and being burnt together upon the funeral pile, it is said that their ashes separated, as if actuated by the implacable resentment which they had borne to each other.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">If we except the Aeneid, this is the only Latin production extant which is epic in its form; and it likewise approaches nearest in merit to that celebrated poem, which Statius appears to have been ambitious of emulating. In unity and greatness of action, the Thebais corresponds to the laws of the Epopea; but the fable may be regarded as defective in some particulars, which, however, arise more from the nature of the subject, than from any fault of the poet. The distinction of the hero is not sufficiently prominent; and the poem</p>",
  "page-978": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">possesses not those circumstances which are requisite towards interesting the reader’s affections in the issue of the contest. To this it may be added, that the unnatural complexion of the incestuous progeny diffuses a kind of gloom which obscures the splendour of thought, and restrains the sympathetic indulgence of fancy to some of the boldest excursions of the poet. For grandeur, however, and animation of sentiment and description, as well as for harmony of numbers, the Thebais is eminently conspicuous, and deserves to be held in a much higher degree of estimation than it has  generally obtained. In the contrivance of some of the episodes, and frequently in the modes of expression, Statius keeps an attentive eye to the style of Virgil. It is said that he was twelve years employed in the composition of this poem; and we have his own authority for affirming, that he polished it with all the care and assiduity practised by the poets in the Augustan age:</p>",

The artifice by which the sagacious ambassador detected Achilles amongst his female companions, was by placing before them various articles of merchandise, amongst which was some armour. Achilles no sooner perceived the latter, than he eagerly seized a sword and shield, and manifesting the strongest emotions of heroic enthusiasm, discovered his sex. After an affectionate parting with Lycomedes’ daughter, Deidamia, whom he left pregnant of a son, he set sail with the Grecian chiefs, and, during the voyage, gives them an account of the manner of his education with Chiron.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This poem consists of two books, in heroic measure, and is written with taste and fancy.

The voyage from Scyros to the Trojan coast, conducted with the celerity which suited the purpose of the poet, admitted of no incidents which required description or recital: and after the voyagers had reached the Grecian camp, it is reasonable to suppose, that the action of the Iliad immediately commenced.

Statius himself affirms, in his Dedication to Stella, that the production of none of them employed him more than two days; yet many of them consist of between one hundred and two hundred hexameter lines. We meet with one of two hundred and sixteen lines; one, of two hundred and thirty-four; one, of two hundred and sixty-two; and one of two hundred and seventy-seven; a rapidity of composition approaching to what Horace mentions of the poet Lucilius. It is no small encomium to observe, that, considered as extemporaneous productions,  the meanest in the collection is far from meriting censure, either in point of sentiment or expression; and many of them contain passages which command our applause.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The poet MARTIAL, surnamed likewise Coquus,</p>",

At the age of twenty-one, he came to Rome, where he lived during five-and-thirty years under the emperors Galba, Otho, Vitellius, the two Vespasians, Domitian, Nerva, and the beginning of the reign of Trajan. He was the panegyrist of several of those emperors, by whom he was liberally rewarded, raised to the Equestrian order, and promoted by Domitian to the tribuneship; but being treated with coldness and neglect by Trajan, he returned to his native country, and, a few years after, ended his days, at the age of seventy-five.</p><p>He had lived at Rome in great splendour and affluence, as well as in high esteem for his poetical talents; but upon his return to Bilbilis, it is said that he experienced a great reverse of fortune, and was chiefly indebted for his support to the gratuitous benefactions of Pliny the Younger, whom he had extolled in some epigrams.</p>",
  "page-985": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The poems of Martial consist of fourteen books, all written in the epigrammatic form, to which species of composition, introduced by the Greeks, he had a peculiar propensity. Amidst such a multitude of verses, on a variety of subjects, often composed extempore, and many of them, probably, in the moments of fashionable dissipation, it is not surprising that we find a large number unworthy the genius of the author. Delicacy, and even decency, is often violated in the productions of Martial. Grasping at every thought which afforded even the shadow of ingenuity, he gave unlimited scope to the exercise of an active and fruitful imagination. In respect to composition, he is likewise liable to censure. At one time he wearies, and at another tantalises the reader, with the prolixity or ambiguity of his preambles. His prelusive sentiments are sometimes far-fetched, and converge not with a natural declination into the focus of epigram. In dispensing praise and censure, he often</p>",

In composition he is, in general, elegant and correct; and where the subject is capable of connection with sentiment, his inventive ingenuity never fails to extract from it the essence of delight and surprise. His fancy is prolific of beautiful images, and his  judgment expert in arranging them to the greatest advantage. He bestows panegyric with inimitable grace, and satirises with equal dexterity. In a fund of Attic salt, he surpasses every other writer; and though he seems to have at command all the varied stores of gall, he is not destitute of candour.

[Aeterna, quae scripsit, non erunt fortasse: ille tamen scripsit tanquam futura.] The character which Martial gives of his epigrams, is just and comprehensive:</p><p>Sunt bona, sunt quaedam mediocria, sunt mala plura,\nQuae legis: hic aliter non fit, Avite, liber.</p><p>Some are good, some indifferent, and some again still worse;\nSuch, Avitus, you will find is a common case with verse.</p><hr class=\"section\">",

Of Him, Capito Atteius , The Well-known Jurisconsult, Says That He Was A Rhetorician Among The Grammarians, And A Grammarian Among The Rhetoricians. Asinius Pollio , In The Book In Which He Finds Fault With The Writings Of Sallust For His Great Affectation Of Obsolete Words, Speaks Thus: “In This Work His Chief Assistant Was A Certain Atteius, A Man Of Rank, A Splendid Latin Grammarian, The Aider And Preceptor Of Those Who Studied The Practice Of Declamation; In Short, One Who Claimed For Himself The Cognomen Of Philologus.” Writing To Lucius Hermas, He Says, “That He Had Made Great Proficiency In Greek Literature, And Some In Latin; That He Had Been A Hearer Of Antonius Gnipho, And His Hermas , And Afterwards Began To Teach Others. Moreover, That He Had For Pupils Many Illustrious Youths, Among Whom Were The Two  Brothers, Appius And Pulcher Claudius; And That He Even Accompanied Them To Their Province.” He Appears To Have Assumed The Name Of Philologus, Because, Like Eratosthenes , Who First Adopted That Cognomen, He Was In High Repute For His Rich And Varied Stores Of Learning; Which, Indeed, Is Evident From His Commentaries, Though But Few Of Them Are Extant. Another Letter, However, To The Same Hermas, Shews That They Were Very Numerous: “Remember,” It Says, “To Recommend Generally Our Extracts, Which We Have Collected, As You Know, Of All Kinds, Into Eight Hundred Books.” He Afterwards Formed An Intimate Acquaintance With Caius Sallustius, And, On His Death, With Asinius Pollio; And When They Undertook To Write A History, He Supplied The One With Short Annals Of All Roman Affairs, From Which He Could Select At Pleasure; And The Other, With Rules On The Art Of Composition. I Am, Therefore, Surprised That Asinius Pollio Should Have Supposed That He Was In The Habit Of Collecting Old Words And Figures Of Speech For Sallust, When He Must Have Known That His Own Advice Was, That None But Well Known, And Common And Appropriate Expressions Should Be Made Use Of; And That, Above All Things, The Obscurity Of The Style Of Sallust, And His Bold Freedom In Translations, Should Be Avoided.</h4><hr class=\"section\">",

Our ancestors have ordained what instruction it is fitting their children should receive, and what schools they should attend.

Some say that he was a captive taken in war, but this, as Fenestella  informs us, could by no means have been the case, since both his birth and death took place in the interval between the termination of the second Punic war and the commencement of the third ; nor, even supposing that he had been taken prisoner by the Numidian or Getulian tribes, could he have fallen into the hands of a</p>",

Terence lived in great familiarity with many persons of high station, and especially with Scipio Africanus, and Caius Delius, whose favour he is even supposed to have purchased by the foulest means. But Fenestella reverses the charge, contending that Terence was older than either of them. Cornelius Nepos, however,  informs us that they were all of nearly equal age; and Porcias intimates a suspicion of this criminal commerce in the following passage:—</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">“While Terence plays the wanton with the great, and recommends himself to them by the meretricious ornaments of his person; while, with greedy ears, he drinks in the divine melody of Africanus’s voice; while he thinks of being a constant guest at the table of Furius, and the handsome Laelius; while he thinks that he is fondly loved by them, and often invited to</p>",
  "page-1047": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Albanum for his youthful beauty, he finds himself stripped of his property, and reduced to the lowest state of indigence. Then, withdrawing from the world, he betook himself to Greece, where he met his end, dying at Strymphalos, a town in Arcadia. What availed him the friendship of Scipio, of Laelius, or of Furius, three of the most affluent nobles of that age? They did not even minister to his necessities so much as to provide him a hired house, to which his slave might return with the intelligence of his master’s death.”</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He wrote comedies, the earliest of which, The Andria, having to be performed at the public spectacles given by the aediles , he was commanded to read it first before Caecilius . Having been introduced while Caecilius was at supper, and being meanly dressed, he is reported to have read the beginning of the play seated on a low stool near the great man’s couch. But after reciting a few verses, he was invited to take his place at</p>",
  "page-1048": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">table, and, having supped with his host, went through the rest to his great delight. This play and five others were received by the public with similar applause, although Volcatius, in his enumeration of them, says that “The Hecyra  must not be reckoned among these.”</p><p>The Eunuch was even acted twice the same day , and earned more money than any comedy, whoever was the writer, had  ever done before, namely, eight thousand sesterces ; besides which, a certain sum accrued to the author for the title. But Varro prefers the opening of The Adelphi  to that of Menander. It is very commonly reported that Terence was assisted in his works by Laelius and Scipio , with whom he lived in such great intimacy. He gave some currency to this report himself, nor did he ever attempt to defend himself against it, except in a light way; as in the prologue to The Adelphi:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Nam quod isti dicunt malevoli, homines nohiles\nHunc adjutare, assidueque una scribere;\nQuod illi</p>",
  "page-1049": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">maledictun vehemens existimant,\nEam laudem hic ducit maximam: cum illis placet,\nQui vobis universis et populo placent;\nQuorum opera in bello, in otio, in negotio,\nSuo quisque tempore usus est sine superbia.</p><p>---—For this,\nWhich malice tells that certain noble persons\nAssist the bard, and write in concert with him,\nThat which they deem a heavy slander, he\nEsteems his greatest praise: that he can please\nThose who in war, in peace, as counsellors,\nHave rendered you the dearest services,\nAnd ever borne their faculties so meekly.\nColman.</p><p>He appears to have protested against this imputation with less earnestness, because the notion was far from being disagreeable to Laelius and Scipio. It therefore gained ground, and prevailed in after-times.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Quintus Memmius, in his speech in his own defence, says “Publius Africanus, who borrowed from Terence a character which he had acted in private,</p>",
  "page-1050": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">brought it on the stage in his name.” Nepos tells us he found in some book that C. Laelius, when he was on some occasion at Puteoli, on the calends [the first] of March,  being requested by his wife to rise early,  begged her not to suffer him to be disturbed, as he had gone to bed late, having been engaged in writing with more than usual success. On her asking him to tell her what he had been writing, he repeated the verses which are found in the Heautontimoroumenos:</p><p>Satis pol proterve me Syri promessa—Heauton. IV. iv. 1.\nI’faith! the rogue Syrus’s impudent pretences—</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Santra  is of opinion that if Terence required any assistance in his compositions , he would not have had recourse to Scipio and Laelius, who were then very young men, but rather to Sulpicius Gallus , an accomplished scholar, who had been the first to introduce his plays at the games given by the consuls; or to Q. Fabius Labeo, or Marcus Popilius , both men of</p>",
  "page-1051": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">consular rank, as well as poets. It was for this reason that, in alluding to the assistance he had received, he did not speak of his coadjutors as very young men, but as persons of whose services the people had full experience in peace, in war, and in the administration of affairs.</p><p>After he had given his comedies to the world, at a time when he had not passed his thirty-fifth year, in order to avoid suspicion, as he found others publishing their works under his name, or else to make himself acquainted with the modes of life and habits of the Greeks, for the purpose of exhibiting them in his plays, he withdrew from home, to which he never returned. Volcatius gives this account of his death:</p><p>Sed ut Afer sei populo dedit comoedias,\nIter hic in Asiam fecit.  Navem cum semel\nConscendit, visus nunquam est.  Sic vita vacat.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When Afer had produced six plays for the entertainment of the\npeople,\nHe embarked for Asia; but</p>",

Others say that he died at Stymphalos, in Arcadia, or in Leucadia, during the consulship of Cn. Cornelius Dolabella and Marcus Fulvius Nobilior , worn out with a severe illness, and with grief and regret for the loss of his baggage, which he had sent forward in a ship that was wrecked, and contained the last new plays he had written.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In person, Terence is reported to have been rather short and slender, with a dark complexion.

Arriving at the age of twenty-one, he formed a friendship with Annaeus Cornutus , which lasted through life; and from him he learned the rudiments of philosophy. Among his earliest friends were Caesius Bassus , and Calpurnius Statura; the latter of whom died while Persius himself was yet in his youth. Servilius  Numanus , he reverenced as a father. Through Cornutus he was introduced to Annaeus, as well as to Lucan, who was of his own age, and also a disciple of Cornutus. At that time Cornutus was a tragic writer; he belonged to the sect of the Stoics, and left behind him some philosophical works. Lucan was so delighted with the writings of Persius Flaccus, that he could scarcely refrain</p>",
  "page-1062": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">from giving loud tokens of applause while the author was reciting them, and declared that they had the true spirit of poetry. It was late before Persius made the acquaintance of Seneca, and then he was not much struck with his natural endowments. At the house of Cornutus he enjoyed the society of two very learned and excellent men, who were then zealously devoting themselves to philosophical enquiries, namely, Claudius Agaternus, a physician from Lacedaemon, and Petronius Aristocrates, of Magnesia, men whom he held in the highest esteem, and with whom he vied in their studies, as they were of his own age, being younger than Cornutus. During nearly the last ten years of his life he was much beloved by Thraseas, so that he sometimes travelled abroad in his company; and his cousin Arria was married to him.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Persius was remarkable for gentle manners, for a modesty amounting to bashfulness, a handsome form,</p>",
  "page-1063": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and an attachment to his mother, sister, and aunt, which was most exemplary. He was frugal and chaste. He left his mother and sister twenty thousand sesterces, requesting his mother, in a written codicil, to present to Cornutus, as some say, one hundred sesterces, or as others, twenty pounds of wrought silver , besides about seven hundred books, which, indeed, included his whole library. Cornutus, however, would only take the books, and gave up the legacy to the sisters, whom his brother had constituted his heirs.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He wrote  seldom, and not very fast; even the work we possess he left incomplete.

But no sooner had he left school and his masters, than he set to work with great vehemence to compose satires, from having read the tenth book of Lucilius; and made the beginning of that book his model; presently launching his invectives all around with so little scruple, that he did not spare cotemporary poets and orators, and even lashed Nero himself, who was then the reigning prince.

I wish, therefore, to deprive you of our Horace: let him leave, therefore, your luxurious table and come to the palace, and he shall assist me in writing my letters.” And upon his refusing to accept the office, he neither exhibited the smallest displeasure, nor ceased to heap upon him</p>",
  "page-1068": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">tokens of his regard. Letters of his are extant, from which I will make some short extracts to establish this: “Use your influence over me with the same freedom as you would do if we were living together as friends. In so doing you will be perfectly right, and guilty of no impropriety; for I could wish that our intercourse should be on that footing, if your health admitted of it.” And again: “How I hold you in memory you may learn  from our friend Septimius , for I happened to mention you when he was present. And if you are so proud as to scorn my friendship, that is no reason why I should lightly esteem yours, in return.” Besides this, among other drolleries, he often called him, “his most immaculate penis,” and “his charming little man,” and loaded him from time to time with proofs of his munificence. He admired his works so much, and was so convinced of their enduring fame, that he directed him to compose the Secular Poem, as well as that on the</p>",
