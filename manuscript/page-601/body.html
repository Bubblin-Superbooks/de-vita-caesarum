In This Frantic And Savage Career, Numbers Had Formed Designs For Cutting Him Off; But One Or Two Conspiracies Being Discovered, And Others Postponed For Want Of Opportunity, At Last Two Men Concerted A Plan Together, And Accomplished Their Purpose; Not Without The Privity Of Some Of The Greatest Favourites Amongst His Freedmen, And The Prefects Of The Pretorian Guards; Because, Having Been Named, Though Falsely, As Concerned In One Conspiracy Against Him, They Perceived That They Were Suspected And Become Objects Of His Hatred. For He Had Immediately Endeavoured To Render Them Obnoxious To The Soldiery, Drawing His Sword, And Declaring, “That He Would Kill Himself If They Thought Him Worthy Of Death;” And Ever After He Was Continually Accusing Them To One Another, And Setting Them All Mutually At Variance. The Conspirators Having Resolved To Fall Upon Him As He Returned At Noon From The Palatine Games, Cassius Chaerea, Tribune Of The Pretorian Guards, Claimed The Part Of Making The Onset. This Chaerea Was Now An Elderly Man, And Had Been Often Reproached By Caius For Effeminacy. When He Came For The Watchword, The Latter Would Give “Priapus,” Or “Venus;” And If On Any Occasion He Returned Thanks, Would Offer Him His Hand To Kiss, Making With His Fingers An Obscene Gesture.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
