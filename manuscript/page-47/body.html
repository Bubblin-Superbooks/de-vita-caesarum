He Endeavoured With Equal Assiduity To Engage In His Interest Princes And Provinces In Every Part Of The World; Presenting Some With Thousands Of Captives, And Sending To Others The Assistance Of Troops, At Whatever Time And Place They Desired, Without Any Authority From Either The Senate Or People Of Rome. He Likewise Embellished With Magnificent Public Buildings The Most Powerful Cities Not Only Of Italy, Gaul, And Spain, But Of Greece And Asia; Until All People Being Now Astonished, And Speculating On The Obvious Tendency Of These Proceedings, Claudius Marcellus, The Consul, Declaring First By Proclamation, That He Intended To Propose A Measure Of The Utmost Importance To The State, Made A Motion In The Senate That Some Person Should Be Appointed To Succeed Caesar In His Province, Before The Term Of His Command Was Expired; Because The War Being Brought To A Conclusion, Peace Was Restored, And The Victorious Army Ought To Be Disbanded. He Further Moved, That Caesar Being Absent, His Claims To Be A Candidate At The Next Election Of Consuls Should Not Be Admitted, As Pompey Himself Had Afterwards Abrogated That Privilege By A Decree Of The People. The Fact Was, That Pompey, In His Law Relating To The Choice Of Chief Magistrates, Had Forgot To Except Caesar, In The Article In Which He Declared All Such As Were Not Present Incapable Of Being Candidates For Any Office; But Soon Afterwards, When The Law Was Inscribed On Brass, And Deposited In The Treasury, He Corrected His Mistake. Marcellus, Not Content With Depriving Caesar Of His Provinces, And The Privilege Intended Him By Pompey, Likewise Moved The Senate, That The Freedom Of The City Should Be Taken From Those Colonists Whom, By The Vatinian Law, He Had Settled At New Como ; Because It Had Been Conferred Upon Them With Ambitious Views, And By A Stretch Of The Laws.</h4></div> </div>
