Having Entered Into A Confederacy With Antony And Lepidus, He Brought The War At Philippi To An End In Two Battles, Although He Was At That Time Weak, And Suffering From Sickness . In The First Battle He Was Driven From His Camp,  And With Some Difficulty Made His Escape To The Wing Of The Army Commanded By Antony. And Now, Intoxicated With Success, He Sent The Head Of Brutus  To Be Cast At The Foot Of Caesar’s Statue, And Treated The Most Illustrious Of The Prisoners Not Only With Cruelty, But With Abusive Language; Insomuch That He Is Said To Have Answered One Of Them Who Humbly Intreated That At Least He Might Not Remain Unburied, “That Will Be In The Power Of The Birds.” Two Others, Father And Son, Who Begged For Their Lives, He Ordered To Cast Lots Which Of Them Should Live, Or Settle It Between Themselves By The Sword; And Was A Spectator Of Both Their Deaths: For The Father Offering His Life To Save His Son, And Being Accordingly Executed, The Son Likewise Killed Himself Upon The Spot. On This Account, The Rest Of The Prisoners, And Amongst Them Marcus Favonius, Cato’s Rival, Being Led Up In Fetters, After They Had Saluted Antony, The General, With Much Respect, Reviled Octavius In The Foulest Language. After This Victory, Dividing Between Them The Offices Of The State, Mark Antony  Undertook To Restore Order In The East, While Caesar Conducted The Veteran Soldiers Back To Italy, And Settled Them In Colonies On The Lands Belonging To The Municipalities. But He Had The Misfortune To Please Neither The Soldiers Nor The Owners Of The Lands; One Party Complaining Of The Injustice Done Them, In Being Violently Ejected From Their Possessions, And The Other, That They Were Not Rewarded According To Their Merit.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
