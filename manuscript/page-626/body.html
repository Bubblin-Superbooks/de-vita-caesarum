<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>X. Having Spent The Greater Part Of His Life Under These And The Like Circumstances, He Came At Last To The Empire In The Fiftieth Year Of His Age , By A Very Surprising Turn Of Fortune. Being, As Well As The Rest, Prevented From Approaching Caius By The Conspirators, Who Dispersed The Crowd, Under The Pretext Of His Desiring To Be Private, He Retired Into An Apartment Called The Hermaeum ; And Soon Afterwards, Terrified By The Report Of Caius Being Slain, He Crept Into An Adjoining Balcony, Where He Hid Himself Behind The Hangings Of  The Door. A Common Soldier, Who Happened To Pass That Way, Spying His Feet, And Desirous To Discover Who He Was, Pulled Him Out; When Immediately Recognizing Him, He Threw Himself In A Great Fright At His Feet, And Saluted Him By The Title Of Emperor. He Then Conducted Him To His Fellow-soldiers, Who Were All In A Great Rage, And Irresolute What They Should Do. They Put Him Into A Litter, And As The Slaves Of The Palace Had All Fled, Took Their Turns In Carrying Him On Their Shoulders, And Brought Him Into The Camp, Sad And Trembling; The People Who Met Him Lamenting His Situation, As If The Poor Innocent Was Being Carried To Execution. Being Received Within The Ramparts , He Continued All Night With The Sentries On Guard, Recovered Somewhat From His Fright, But In No Great Hopes Of The Succession. For The Consuls, With The Senate And Civic Troops, Had Possessed Themselves Of The Forum And Capitol, With The Determination To Assert The Public Liberty; And He Being Sent For Likewise, By A Tribune Of The People, To The Senate-house, To Give His Advice Upon The Present Juncture Of Affairs, Returned Answer, “I Am Under Constraint, And Cannot Possibly Come.” The Day Afterwards, The Senate Being Dilatory In Their Proceedings, And Worn Out By Divisions Amongst Themselves, While The People Who Surrounded The Senate-house Shouted That They Would Have One Master, Naming Claudius, He Suffered The Soldiers Assembled Under Arms To Swear Allegiance To Him, Promising Them Fifteen Thousand Sesterces A Man; He Being The First Of The Caesars Who Purchased The Submission Of The Soldiers With Money.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
