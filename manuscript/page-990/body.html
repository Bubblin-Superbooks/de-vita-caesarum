The Science Of Grammar  Was In Ancient Times Far From Being In Vogue At Rome; Indeed, It Was Of Little Use In A Rude State Of Society, When The People Were Engaged In Constant Wars, And Had Not Much Time To Bestow On The Cultivation Of The Liberal Arts . At The Outset, Its Pretensions Were Very Slender, For The Earliest Men Of Learning, Who Were Both Poets And Orators, May Be Considered As Half-greek: I Speak Of Livius  And Ennius , Who Are Acknowledged To Have Taught Both Languages As Well At Rome As In Foreign Parts . But They  Only Translated From The Greek, And If They Composed Anything Of Their Own In Latin, It Was Only From What They Had Before Read. For Although There Are Those Who Say That This Ennius Published Two Books, One On “Letters And Syllables,” And The Other On “Metres,” Lucius Cotta Has Satisfactorily Proved That They Are Not The Works Of The Poet Ennius, But Of Another Writer Of The Same Name, To Whom Also The Treatise On The “Rules Of Augury” Is Attributed.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
