<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>D. Junius Juvenalis, Who Was Either The Son  Of A Wealthy Freedman, Or Brought Up By Him, It Is Not Known Which, Declaimed Till The Middle Of Life , More From The Bent Of His Inclination, Than From Any Desire To Prepare Himself Either For The Schools Or The Forum. But Having Composed A Short Satire , Which Was Clever Enough, On Paris , The Actor Of Pantomimes,  And Also On The Poet Of Claudius Nero, Who Was Puffed Up By Having Held Some Inferior Military Rank For Six Months Only; He Afterwards Devoted Himself With Much Zeal To That Style Of Writing. For A While Indeed, He Had Not The Courage To Read Them Even To A Small Circle Of Auditors, But It Was Not Long Before He Recited His Satires To Crowded Audiences, And With Entire Success; And This He Did Twice Or Thrice, Inserting New Lines Among Those Which He Had Originally Composed.</h4></div> </div>
