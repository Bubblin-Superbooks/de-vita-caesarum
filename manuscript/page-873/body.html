After The Deaths Of Nero And Galba, Whilst Otho And Vitellius Were Contending For The Sovereignty, He Entertained Hopes Of Obtaining The Empire, With The Prospect Of Which He Had Long Before Flattered Himself, From The Following Omens. Upon An Estate Belonging To The Flavian Family, In The Neighbourhood Of Rome, There Was An Old Oak, Sacred To Mars, Which, At The Three Several Deliveries Of Vespasia, Put Out Each Time A New Branch; Evident Intimations Of The Future Fortune Of Each Child. The First Was But A Slender One, Which Quickly Withered Away; And Accordingly, The Girl That Was Born Did Not Live Long. The Second Became Vigorous, Which Portended Great Good Fortune; But The Third Grew Like A Tree. His Father, Sabinus, Encouraged By These Omens, Which Were Confirmed By The Augurs, Told His Mother, “That Her Grandson Would Be Emperor Of Rome;” At Which She Laughed Heartily, Wondering, She Said, “That Her Son Should Be In His Dotage Whilst She Continued Still In Full Possession Of Her Faculties.”</h4></div> </div>
