His Vices Gaining Strength By Degrees, He Laid Aside His Jocular Amusements, And All Disguise; Breaking Out Into Enormous Crimes, Without The Least Attempt To Conceal Them. His Revels Were Prolonged From Mid-day To Midnight, While He Was Frequently Refreshed By Warm Baths, And, In The Summer Time, By Such As Were Cooled With Snow. He Often Supped In Public, In The Naumachia, With The Sluices Shut, Or In The Campus Martius, Or The Circus Maximus, Being Waited Upon At Table By Common Prostitutes Of The Town, And Syrian Strumpets And Glee-girls. As Often As He Went Down The Tiber To Ostia, Or Coasted Through The Gulf Of Baiae, Booths Furnished As Brothels And Eating-houses, Were Erected Along The Shore And River Banks; Before Which Stood Matrons, Who, Like Bawds And Hostesses, Allured Him To Land. It Was Also His Custom To Invite  Himself To Supper With His Friends; At One Of Which Was Expended No Less Than Four Millions Of Sesterces In Chaplets, And At Another Something More In Roses.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
