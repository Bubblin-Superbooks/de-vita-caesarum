After A Slight Repast At Noon, He Used To Seek Repose , Dressed As He Was, And With His Shoes On, His Feet Covered, And His Hand Held Before His Eyes. After Supper He Commonly Withdrew To His Study, A Small Closet, Where He Sat Late, Until He Had Put Down In His Diary All Or Most Of The Remaining Transactions Of The Day, Which He Had Not Before Registered. He Would Then Go To Bed, But Never Slept Above Seven Hours At Most, And That Not Without Interruption; For He Would Wake Three Or Four Times During That Time. If He Could Not Again Fall Asleep, As Sometimes Happened, He Called For Some One To Read Or Tell Stories To Him, Until He Became Drowsy, And Then His Sleep Was Usually Protracted Till After Day-break. He Never Liked To Lie Awake In The Dark, Without Somebody To Sit By Him. Very Early Rising Was Apt To Disagree With Him. On Which Account, If He Was Obliged To Rise Betimes, For Any Civil Or Religious Functions, In Order To Guard As Much As Possible Against The Inconvenience Resulting From It, He Used To Lodge In Some Apartment Near The Spot, Belonging To Any Of His Attendants. If At Any Time A Fit Of Drowsiness Seized Him In Passing Along The Streets, His Litter Was Set Down While He Snatched A Few Momentsâ€™ Sleep.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
