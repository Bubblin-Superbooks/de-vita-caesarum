In His Way, Some Person Having Thrust Into His Hand A Paper, Warning Him Against The Plot, He Mixed It With Some Other Documents Which He Held In His Left Hand, Intending To Read It At Leisure. Victim After Victim Was Slain, Without Any Favourable Appearances In The Entrails; But Still, Disregarding All Omens, He Entered The Senate-house, Laughing At Spurinna As A False Prophet, Because The Ides Of March Were Come, Without Any Mischief Having Befallen Him. To Which The Soothsayer Replied, “They Are Come, Indeed, But Not Past.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
