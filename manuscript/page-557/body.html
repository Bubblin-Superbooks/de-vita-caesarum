He Exhibited Some Combats Of Gladiators, Either In The Amphitheatre Of Taurus , Or In The Septa, With Which He Intermingled Troops Of The Best Pugilists From Campania And Africa. He Did Not Always Preside In Person Upon Those Occasions, But Sometimes Gave A Commission To Magistrates Or Friends To Supply His Place. He Frequently Entertained The People With Stage-plays  Of Various Kinds, And In Several Parts Of The City, And Sometimes By Night, When He Caused The Whole City To Be Lighted. He Likewise Gave Various Things To Be Scrambled For Among The People, And Distributed To Every Man A Basket Of Bread With Other Victuals. Upon This Occasion, He Sent His Own Share To A Roman Knight, Who Was Seated Opposite To Him, And Was Enjoying Himself By Eating Heartily. To A Senator, Who Was Doing The Same, He Sent An Appointment Of Praetor-extraordinary. He Likewise Exhibited A Great Number Of Circensian Games From Morning Until Night; Intermixed With The Hunting Of Wild Beasts From Africa, Or The Trojan Exhibition. Some Of These Games Were Celebrated With Peculiar Circumstances; The Circus Being Overspread With Vermilion And Chrysolite; And None Drove In The Chariot Races Who Were Not Of The Senatorian Order. For Some Of These He Suddenly Gave The Signal, When, Upon His Viewing From The Gelotiana  The Preparations In The Circus, He Was Asked To Do So By A Few Persons In The Neighbouring Galleries.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
