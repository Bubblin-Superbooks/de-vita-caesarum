He Often Distributed Largesses Of Corn And Money Among The People, And Entertained Them With A Great Variety Of Public Magnificent Spectacles, Not Only Such As Were Usual, And In The Accustomed Places, But Some Of New Invention, And Others Revived From Ancient Models, And Exhibited In Places Where Nothing Of The Kind Had Been Ever Before Attempted. In The Games Which He Presented At The Dedication Of Pompey’s Theatre , Which Had Been Burnt Down, And Was Rebuilt By Him, He Presided Upon A Tribunal Erected For Him In The Orchestra; Having First Paid His Devotions, In The Temple Above, And Then Coming Down Through The Centre Of The Circle, While All The People Kept Their Seats In Profound Silence . He Likewise  Joined By The Common People, Count Upon His Fingers Aloud The Gold Pieces Presented To Those Who Came Off Conquerors. He Would Earnestly Invite The Company To Be Merry; Sometimes Calling Them His “Masters,” With A Mixture Of Insipid, Far-fetched Jests. Thus, When The People Called For Palumbus , He Said, “He Would Give Them One When He Could Catch It.” The Following Was Well-intended, And Well-timed; Having, Amidst Great Applause, Spared A Gladiator, On The Intercession Of His Four Sons, He Sent A Billet Immediately Round The Theatre, To Remind The People, “How Much It Behoved Them To Get Children, Since They Had Before Them An Example How Useful They Had Been In Procuring Favour And Security For A Gladiator.” He Likewise Represented In The Campus Martius, The Assault And Sacking Of A Town, And The Surrender Of The British Kings , Presiding In His General’s Cloak. Immediately Before He Drew Off The Waters From The Fucine Lake, He Exhibited Upon It A Naval Fight. But The Combatants On Board The Fleets Crying Out, “Health Attend You, Noble Emperor! We, Who Are About To Peril Our Lives, Salute You;” And He Replying, “Health Attend You Too,” They All Refused To Fight, As If By That Response He Had Meant To Excuse Them. Upon This, He Hesitated For A Time, Whether He Should Not Destroy Them All With Fire And Sword. At Last, Leaping From His Seat, And Running Along The Shore Of The Lake With Tottering Steps, The Result Of His Foul Excesses, He, Partly By Fair Words, And Partly By Threats, Persuaded Them To Engage. This Spectacle Represented An Engagement Between The Fleets Of Sicily And Rhodes; Consisting Each Of Twelve Ships Of War, Of Three Banks Of Oars. The Signal For The Encounter Was Given By A Silver Triton, Raised By Machinery From The Middle Of The Lake.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
