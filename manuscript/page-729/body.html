The World, After Tolerating Such An Emperor For Little Less Than Fourteen Years, At Length Forsook Him; The Gauls, Headed By Julius Vindex, Who At That Time Governed The Province As Pro-praetor, Being The First To Revolt. Nero Had Been Formerly Told By Astrologers, That It Would Be His Fortune To Be At Last Deserted By All The World; And This Occasioned That Celebrated Saying Of His, “An Artist Can Live In Any Country;” By Which He Meant To Offer As An Excuse For His Practice Of Music, That It Was Not Only His Amusement As A Prince, But Might Be His Support When Reduced To A Private Station. Yet Some Of The Astrologers Promised Him, In His Forlorn State, The Rule Of The East, And Some In Express Words The Kingdom Of Jerusalem. But The Greater Part Of Them Flattered Him With Assurances Of His Being Restored To His Former Fortune. And Being Most Inclined To Believe The Latter Prediction, Upon Losing Britain And Armenia, He Imagined He Had Run Through All The Misfortunes Which The Fates Had Decreed Him. But When, Upon Consulting The Oracle Of Apollo At Delphi, He Was Advised To Beware Of The Seventy-third Year, As If He Were Not To Die Till Then, Never Thinking Of Galba’s Age, He Conceived Such Hopes, Not Only Of Living To Advanced Years, But Of Constant And Singular Good Fortune, That Having Lost Some Things Of Great Value By Shipwreck, He Scrupled Not To Say Amongst His Friends, That  “The Fishes Would Bring Them Back To Him.” At Naples He Heard Of The Insurrection In Gaul, On The Anniversary Of The Day On Which He Killed His Mother, And Bore It With So Much Unconcern, As To Excite A Suspicion That He Was Really Glad Of It, Since He Had Now A Fair Opportunity Of Plundering Those Wealthy Provinces By The Right Of War. Immediately Going To The Gymnasium, He Witnessed The Exercise Of The Wrestlers With The Greatest Delight. Being Interrupted At Supper With Letters Which Brought Yet Worse News, He Expressed No Greater Resentment, Than Only To Threaten The Rebels. For Eight Days Together, He Never Attempted To Answer Any Letters, Nor Give Any Orders, But Buried The Whole Affair In Profound Silence.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
