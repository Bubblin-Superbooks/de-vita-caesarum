In The Devices Of His Profuse Expenditure, He Surpassed All The Prodigals That Ever Lived; Inventing A New Kind Of Bath, With Strange Dishes And Suppers, Washing In Precious Unguents, Both Warm And Cold, Drinking Pearls Of Immense Value Dissolved In Vinegar, And Serving Up For His Guests Loaves And Other Victuals Modelled In Gold; Often Saying, “That A Man Ought Either To Be A Good Economist Or An Emperor.” Besides, He Scattered Money To A Prodigious Amount Among The People, From The Top Of The Julian Basilica , During Several Days Successively. He Built Two Ships With Ten Banks Of Oars, After The Liburnian Fashion, The Poops Of Which Blazed With Jewels, And The Sails Were Of Various Parti-colours. They Were Fitted Up With Ample Baths, Galleries, And Saloons, And Supplied With A Great Variety Of Vines And Other Fruit-trees. In These He Would Sail In The Day-time Along The Coast Of Campania, Feasting  Amidst Dancing And Concerts Of Music. In Building His Palaces And Villas, There Was Nothing He Desired To Effect So Much, In Defiance Of All Reason, As What Was Considered Impossible. Accordingly, Moles Were Formed In The Deep And Adverse Sea , Rocks Of The Hardest Stone Cut Away, Plains Raised To The Height Of Mountains With A Vast Mass Of Earth, And The Tops Of Mountains Levelled By Digging; And All These Were To Be Executed With Incredible Speed, For The Least Remissness Was A Capital Offence. Not To Mention Particulars, He Spent Enormous Sums, And The Whole Treasures Which Had Been Amassed By Tiberius Caesar, Amounting To Two Thousand Seven Hundred Millions Of Sesterces, Within Less Than A Year.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
