It Will Scarcely Be Found, That So Much As One Innocent Person Suffered In His Reign, Unless In His Absence, And Without His Knowledge, Or, At Least, Contrary To His Inclination, And When He Was Imposed Upon. Although Helvidius Priscus  Was The Only Man Who Presumed To Salute Him On His Return From Syria By His Private Name Of Vespasian, And, When He Came To Be Praetor, Omitted Any Mark Of Honour To Him, Or Even Any Mention Of Him In His Edicts, Yet He Was Not Angry, Until Helvidius Proceeded To Inveigh Against Him With The Most Scurrilous Language.  Though He Did Indeed Banish Him, And Afterwards Ordered Him To Be Put To Death, Yet He Would Gladly Have Saved Him Notwithstanding, And Accordingly Dispatched Messengers To Fetch Back The Executioners; And He Would Have Saved Him, Had He Not Been Deceived By A False Account Brought, That He Had Already Perished. He Never Rejoiced At The Death Of Any Man; Nay He Would Shed Tears, And Sigh, At The Just Punishment Of The Guilty.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
