He Completed His Palace By Continuing It From The Palatine To The Esquiline Hill, Calling The Building At First Only “The Passage,” But, After It Was Burnt Down And Rebuilt, “The Golden House.”  Of Its Dimensions And Furniture, It May Be Sufficient To Say Thus Much: The Porch Was So High That There Stood In It A Colossal Statue Of Himself A Hundred And Twenty Feet In Height; And The Space Included In It Was So Ample, That It Had Triple Porticos A Mile In Length, And A Lake Like A Sea, Surrounded With Buildings Which Had The Appearance Of A City. Within Its Area Were Corn Fields, Vineyards, Pastures, And Woods, Containing A Vast Number Of Animals Of Various Kinds, Both Wild And Tame. In Other Parts It Was Entirely Over-laid With Gold, And Adorned With Jewels And Mother Of Pearl. The Supper Rooms Were Vaulted, And Compartments Of The Ceilings, Inlaid With Ivory, Were Made To Revolve, And Scatter Flowers; While They Contained Pipes Which  Shed Unguents Upon The Guests. The Chief Banqueting Room Was Circular, And Revolved Perpetually, Night And Day, In Imitation Of The Motion Of The Celestial Bodies. The Baths Were Supplied With Water From The Sea And The Albula. Upon The Dedication Of This Magnificent House After It Was Finished, All He Said In Approval Of It Was, “That He Had Now A Dwelling Fit For A Man.” He Commenced Making A Pond For The Reception Of All The Hot Streams From Baiae, Which He Designed To Have Continued From Misenum To The Avernian Lake, In A Conduit, Enclosed In Galleries; And Also A Canal From Avernum To Ostia, That Ships Might Pass From One To The Other, Without A Sea Voyage. The Length Of The Proposed Canal Was One Hundred And Sixty Miles; And It Was Intended To Be Of Breadth Sufficient To Permit Ships With Five Banks Of Oars To Pass Each Other. For The Execution Of These Designs, He Ordered All Prisoners, In Every Part Of The Empire, To Be Brought To Italy; And That Even Those Who Were Convicted Of The Most Heinous Crimes, In Lieu Of Any Other Sentence, Should Be Condemned To Work At Them. He Was Encouraged To All This Wild And Enormous Profusion, Not Only By The Great Revenue Of The Empire, But By The Sudden Hopes Given Him Of An Immense Hidden Treasure, Which Queen Dido, Upon Her Flight From Tyre, Had Brought With Her To Africa. This, A Roman Knight Pretended To Assure Him, Upon Good Grounds, Was Still Hid There In Some Deep Caverns, And Might With A Little Labour Be Recovered.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
