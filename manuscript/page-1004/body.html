<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>X. Atteius, The Philologist, A Freedman, Was Born At Athens. Of Him, Capito Atteius , The Well-known Jurisconsult, Says That He Was A Rhetorician Among The Grammarians, And A Grammarian Among The Rhetoricians. Asinius Pollio , In The Book In Which He Finds Fault With The Writings Of Sallust For His Great Affectation Of Obsolete Words, Speaks Thus: “In This Work His Chief Assistant Was A Certain Atteius, A Man Of Rank, A Splendid Latin Grammarian, The Aider And Preceptor Of Those Who Studied The Practice Of Declamation; In Short, One Who Claimed For Himself The Cognomen Of Philologus.” Writing To Lucius Hermas, He Says, “That He Had Made Great Proficiency In Greek Literature, And Some In Latin; That He Had Been A Hearer Of Antonius Gnipho, And His Hermas , And Afterwards Began To Teach Others. Moreover, That He Had For Pupils Many Illustrious Youths, Among Whom Were The Two  Brothers, Appius And Pulcher Claudius; And That He Even Accompanied Them To Their Province.” He Appears To Have Assumed The Name Of Philologus, Because, Like Eratosthenes , Who First Adopted That Cognomen, He Was In High Repute For His Rich And Varied Stores Of Learning; Which, Indeed, Is Evident From His Commentaries, Though But Few Of Them Are Extant. Another Letter, However, To The Same Hermas, Shews That They Were Very Numerous: “Remember,” It Says, “To Recommend Generally Our Extracts, Which We Have Collected, As You Know, Of All Kinds, Into Eight Hundred Books.” He Afterwards Formed An Intimate Acquaintance With Caius Sallustius, And, On His Death, With Asinius Pollio; And When They Undertook To Write A History, He Supplied The One With Short Annals Of All Roman Affairs, From Which He Could Select At Pleasure; And The Other, With Rules On The Art Of Composition. I Am, Therefore, Surprised That Asinius Pollio Should Have Supposed That He Was In The Habit Of Collecting Old Words And Figures Of Speech For Sallust, When He Must Have Known That His Own Advice Was, That None But Well Known, And Common And Appropriate Expressions Should Be Made Use Of; And That, Above All Things, The Obscurity Of The Style Of Sallust, And His Bold Freedom In Translations, Should Be Avoided.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
