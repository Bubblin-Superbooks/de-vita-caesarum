<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xli. By The Encouragement Of Titus Livius , And With The Assistance Of Sulpicius Flavus, He Attempted At An Early Age The Composition Of A History; And Having Called Together A Numerous Auditory, To Hear And Give Their Judgment Upon It, He Read It Over With Much Difficulty, And Frequently Interrupting Himself. For After He Had Begun, A Great Laugh Was Raised Amongst The Company, By The Breaking Of Several Benches From The Weight Of A Very Fat Man; And Even When Order Was Restored, He Could Not Forbear Bursting Out Into Violent Fits Of Laughter, At The Remembrance Of The Accident. After He Became Emperor, Likewise, He Wrote Several Things  Which He Was Careful To Have Recited To His Friends By A Reader. He Commenced His History From The Death Of The Dictator Caesar; But Afterwards He Took A Later Period, And Began At The Conclusion Of The Civil Wars; Because He Found He Could Not Speak With Freedom, And A Due Regard To Truth, Concerning The Former Period, Having Been Often Taken To Task Both By His Mother And Grandmother. Of The Earlier History He Left Only Two Books, But Of The Latter, One And Forty. He Compiled Likewise The “History Of His Own Life,” In Eight Books, Full Of Absurdities, But In No Bad Style; Also, “A Defence Of Cicero Against The Books Of Asinius Gallus,”  Which Exhibited A Considerable Degree Of Learning. He Besides Invented Three New Letters, And Added Them To The Former Alphabet , As Highly Necessary. He Published A Book To Recommend Them While He Was Yet Only A Private Person; But On His Elevation To Imperial Power He Had Little Difficulty In Introducing Them Into Common Use; And These Letters Are Still Extant In A Variety Of Books, Registers, And Inscriptions Upon Buildings.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
