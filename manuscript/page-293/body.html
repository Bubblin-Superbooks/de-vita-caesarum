Happening To Sail By The Bay Of Puteoli, The Passengers And Mariners Aboard A Ship Of Alexandria , Just Then Arrived, Clad All In White, With Chaplets Upon Their Heads, And Offering Incense, Loaded Him With Praises And Joyful Acclamations, Crying Out, “By You We Live, By You We Sail Securely, By You Enjoy Our Liberty And Our Fortunes.” At Which Being Greatly Pleased, He Distributed To Each Of Those Who Attended Him, Forty Gold Pieces, Requiring From Them An Assurance On Oath, Not To Employ The Sum Given Them In Any Other Way, Than The Purchase Of Alexandrian Merchandize. And During Several Days Afterwards, He Distributed Togae  And Pallia, Among Other Gifts, On Condition That The Romans Should Use The Greek, And The Greeks The Roman Dress And Language. He Likewise Constantly Attended To See The Boys Perform Their Exercises, According To An Ancient Custom Still Continued At Capri. He Gave Them Likewise An Entertainment In His Presence, And Not Only Permitted, But Required From Them The Utmost Freedom In Jesting, And Scrambling For Fruit, Victuals, And Other Things Which He Threw Amongst Them. In A Word, He Indulged Himself In All The Ways Of Amusement He Could Contrive.</h4></div> </div>
