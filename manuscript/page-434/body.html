The Ambassadors Of The Parthians, After Having Had An Audience Of Augustus, Were Ordered To Apply To Him Likewise In His Province. But On Receiving Intelligence Of An Insurrection In Illyricum , He Went Over To Superintend The Management Of That New War, Which Proved The Most Serious Of All The Foreign Wars Since The Carthaginian.
