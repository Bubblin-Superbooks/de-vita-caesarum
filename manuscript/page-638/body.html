With Regard To Religious Ceremonies, The Administration Of Affairs Both Civil And Military, And The Condition Of All Orders Of The People At Home And Abroad, Some Practices He Corrected, Others Which Had Been Laid Aside He Revived; And Some Regulations He Introduced Which Were Entirely New. In Appointing New Priests For The Several Colleges, He Made No Appointments Without Being Sworn. When An Earthquake  Happened In The City, He Never Failed To Summon The People Together By The Praetor, And Appoint Holidays For Sacred Rites.
