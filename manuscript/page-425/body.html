After Assuming The Manly Habit, He Spent His Youth, And The Rest Of His Life Until He Succeeded To The Government, In The Following Manner: He Gave The People An Entertainment Of Gladiators, In Memory Of His Father, And Another For His Grandfather Drusus, At Different Times And In Different Places: The First In The Forum, The Second In The Amphitheatre; Some Gladiators Who Had Been Honourably Discharged, Being Induced To Engage Again, By A Reward Of A Hundred Thousand Sesterces. He Likewise Exhibited Public Sports, At Which He Was Not Present Himself. All These He Performed With Great Magnificence, At The Expense Of His Mother And Father-in-law. He Married Agrippina, The Daughter Of Marcus Agrippa, And Grand-daughter Of Caecilius Atticus, A Roman Knight, The Same Person To Whom Cicero Has Addressed So Many Epistles. After Having By Her His Son Drusus, He Was Obliged To Part With Her , Though She Retained His Affection, And Was Again Pregnant, To Make Way For Marrying Augustusâ€™s Daughter Julia. But This He Did With Extreme Reluctance; For, Besides Having The Warmest Attachment To Agrippina, He Was Disgusted With The Conduct Of Julia, Who Had Made Indecent Advances To Him During The Lifetime Of Her Former Husband; And That She Was A Woman Of Loose Character, Was The General Opinion. At Divorcing Agrippina He Felt The Deepest Regret; And Upon Meeting Her Afterwards,  He Looked After Her With Eyes So Passionately Expressive Of Affection, That Care Was Taken She Should Never Again Come In His Sight. At First, However, He Lived Quietly And Happily With Julia; But A Rupture Soon Ensued, Which Became So Violent, That After The Loss Of Their Son, The Pledge Of Their Union, Who Was Born At Aquileia And Died In Infancy , He Never Would Sleep With Her More. He Lost His Brother Drusus In Germany, And Brought His Body To Rome, Travelling All The Way On Foot Before It.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
