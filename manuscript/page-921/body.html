<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Ix. Having Declared That He Accepted The Office Of Pontifex Maximus For The Purpose Of Preserving His Hands Undefiled, He Faithfully Adhered To His Promise. For After That Time He Was Neither Directly Nor Indirectly Concerned In The Death Of Any Person, Though He Sometimes Was Justly Irritated. He Swore “That He Would Perish Himself, Rather Than Prove The Destruction Of Any Man.” Two Men Of Patrician Rank Being Convicted Of Aspiring To The Empire, He Only Advised Them To Desist, Saying, “That The Sovereign Power Was Disposed Of By Fate,” And Promised Them, That If There Was Any Thing Else They Desired Of Him, He Would Grant It. He Also Immediately Sent Messengers To The Mother Of One Of Them, Who Was At A Great Distance, And In Deep Anxiety About Her Son, To Assure Her Of His Safety. Nay, He Not Only Invited Them To Sup With  Him, But Next Day, At A Show Of Gladiators, Purposely Placed Them Close By Him; And Handed To Them The Arms Of The Combatants For His Inspection. It Is Said Likewise, That Having Had Their Nativities Cast, He Assured Them, “That A Great Calamity Was Impending On Both Of Them, But From Another Hand, And Not From His.” Though His Brother Was Continually Plotting Against Him, Almost Openly Stirring Up The Armies To Rebellion, And Contriving To Get Away, Yet He Could Not Endure To Put Him To Death, Or To Banish Him From His Presence; Nor Did He Treat Him With Less Respect Than Before. But From His First Accession To The Empire, He Constantly Declared Him His Partner In It, And That He Should Be His Successor; Begging Of Him Sometimes In Private, With Tears In His Eyes, “To Return The Affection He Had For Him.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
