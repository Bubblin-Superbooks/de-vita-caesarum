Intelligence Of Galbaâ€™s Death Arriving Soon After, When He Had Settled His Affairs In Germany He Divided His Troops Into Two Bodies, Intending To Send One Of Them Before Him Against Otho, And To Follow With The Other Himself. The Army He Sent Forward Had A Lucky Omen; For, Suddenly, An Eagle Cams Flying Up To Them On The Right, And Having Hovered  Round The Standards, Flew Gently Before Them On Their Road. But, On The Other Hand, When He Began His Own March, All The Equestrian Statues, Which Were Erected For Him In Several Places, Fell Suddenly Down With Their Legs Broken; And The Laurel Crown, Which He Had Put On As Emblematical Of Auspicious Fortune, Fell Off His Head Into A River. Soon Afterwards, At Vienne , As He Was Upon The Tribunal Administering Justice, A Cock Perched Upon His Shoulder, And Afterwards Upon His Head. The Issue Corresponded To These Omens; For He Was Not Able To Keep The Empire Which Had Been Secured For Him By His Lieutenants.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
