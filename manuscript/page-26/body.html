In His Aedileship, He Not Only Embellished The Comitium, And The Rest Of The Forum , With The Adjoining Halls , But Adorned The Capitol Also, With Temporary Piazzas, Constructed For The Purpose Of Displaying Some Part Of The Superabundant Collections  He Had Made For The Amusement Of The People . He Entertained Them With The Hunting Of Wild Beasts, And With Games, Both Alone And In Conjunction With His Colleague. On This Account, He Obtained The Whole Credit Of The Expense To Which They Had Jointly Contributed; Insomuch That His Colleague, Marcus Bibulus, Could Not Forbear Remarking, That He Was Served In The Manner Of Pollux. For As The Temple  Erected In The Forum To The Two Brothers, Went By The Name Of Castor Alone, So His And Caesarâ€™s Joint Munificence Was Imputed To The Latter Only. To The Other Public Spectacles Exhibited To The People, Caesar Added A Fight Of Gladiators, But With Fewer Pairs Of Combatants Than He Had Intended. For He Had Collected From All Parts So Great A Company Of Them, That His Enemies Became Alarmed; And A Decree Was Made, Restricting The Number Of Gladiators Which Any One Was Allowed To Retain At Rome.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
