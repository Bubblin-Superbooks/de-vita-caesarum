Upon The News Of Caiusâ€™s Death, Though Many Earnestly Pressed Him To Lay Hold Of That Opportunity Of Seizing The Empire, He Chose Rather To Be Quiet. On This Account, He Was In Great Favour With Claudius, And Being Received Into The Number Of His Friends, Stood So High In His Good Opinion, That The Expedition To Britain  Was For Some Time Suspended, Because He Was Suddenly Seized With A Slight Indisposition. He Governed Africa, As Pro-consul, For Two Years; Being Chosen Out Of The Regular Course To Restore Order In The Province, Which Was In Great Disorder From Civil Dissensions, And The Alarms Of The Barbarians. His Administration Was Distinguished By Great Strictness And Equity, Even In Matters Of Small Importance. A Soldier Upon Some Expedition Being Charged With Selling, In A Great Scarcity Of Corn, A Bushel Of Wheat, Which Was All He Had Left, For A Hundred Denarii, He Forbad Him To Be Relieved By Any Body, When He Came To Be In Want Himself; And Accordingly He Died Of Famine. When Sitting In Judgment, A Cause Being Brought Before Him About Some Beast Of Burden, The Ownership Of Which Was Claimed By Two Persons; The Evidence Being Slight On Both Sides, And It Being Difficult To Come At The Truth, He Ordered The Beast To Be Led To A Pond At Which He Had Used To Be Watered, With His Head Muffled Up, And The Covering Being There Removed, That He Should Be The Property Of The Person Whom He Followed Of His Own Accord, After Drinking.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
