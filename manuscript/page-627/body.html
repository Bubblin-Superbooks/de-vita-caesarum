Having Thus Established Himself In Power, His First Object Was To Abolish All Remembrance Of The Two Preceding Days, In Which A Revolution In The State Had Been Canvassed. Accordingly, He Passed An Act Of Perpetual Oblivion And Pardon For Every Thing Said Or Done During That Time; And This He Faithfully Observed, With The Exception Only Of Putting To Death A Few Tribunes And Centurions Concerned In The Conspiracy Against Caius, Both As An Example, And Because He Understood That They Had Also Planned His Own Death. He Now Turned  His Thoughts Towards Paying Respect To The Memory Of His Relations. His Most Solemn And Usual Oath Was, “By Augustus.” He Prevailed Upon The Senate To Decree Divine Honours To His Grandmother Livia, With A Chariot In The Circensian Procession Drawn By Elephants, As Had Been Appointed For Augustus ; And Public Offerings To The Shades Of His Parents. Besides Which, He Instituted Circensian Games For His Father, To Be Celebrated Every Year, Upon His Birth-day, And, For His Mother, A Chariot To Be Drawn Through The Circus; With The Title Of Augusta, Which Had Been Refused By His Grandmother . To The Memory Of His Brother , To Which, Upon All Occasions, He Showed A Great Regard, He Gave A Greek Comedy, To Be Exhibited In The Public Diversions At Naples , And Awarded The Crown For It, According To The Sentence Of The Judges In That Solemnity. Nor Did He Omit To Make Honourable And Grateful Mention Of Mark Antony; Declaring By A Proclamation, “That He The More Earnestly Insisted Upon The Observation Of His Father Drusus’s Birth-day, Because It Was Likewise That Of His Grandfather Antony.” He Completed The Marble Arch Near Pompey’s Theatre, Which Had Formerly Been Decreed By The Senate In Honour Of Tiberius, But Which Had Been Neglected . And Though He Cancelled All The Acts Of Caius, Yet He Forbad The Day Of His Assassination, Notwithstanding It Was That Of His Own Accession To The Empire, To Be Reckoned Amongst The Festivals.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
