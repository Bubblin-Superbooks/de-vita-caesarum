He Generally Viewed The Circensian Games Himself, From The Upper Rooms Of The Houses Of His Friends Or Freedmen; Sometimes From The Place Appointed For The Statues Of The Gods, And Sitting In Company With His Wife And Children. He  Occasionally Absented Himself From The Spectacles For Several Hours, And Sometimes For Whole Days; But Not Without First Making An Apology, And Appointing Substitutes To Preside In His Stead. When Present, He Never Attended To Anything Else Either To Avoid The Reflections Which He Used To Say Were Commonly Made Upon His Father, Caesar, For Perusing Letters And Memorials, And Making Rescripts During The Spectacles; Or From The Real Pleasure He Took In Attending Those Exhibitions; Of Which He Made No Secret, He Often Candidly Owning It. This He Manifested Frequently By Presenting Honorary Crowns And Handsome Rewards To The Best Performers, In The Games Exhibited By Others; And He Never Was Present At Any Performance Of The Greeks, Without Rewarding The Most Deserving, According To Their Merit. He Took Particular Pleasure In Witnessing Pugilistic Contests, Especially Those Of The Latins, Not Only Between Combatants Who Had Been Trained Scientifically, Whom He Used Often To Match With The Greek Champions; But Even Between Mobs Of The Lower Classes Fighting In Streets, And Tilting At Random, Without Any Knowledge Of The Art. In Short, He Honoured With His Patronage All Sorts Of People Who Contributed In Any Way To The Success Of The Public Entertainments. He Not Only Maintained, But Enlarged, The Privileges Of The Wrestlers. He Prohibited Combats Of Gladiators Where No Quarter Was Given. He Deprived The Magistrates Of The Power Of Correcting The Stage-players, Which By An Ancient Law Was Allowed Them At All Times, And In All Places; Restricting Their Jurisdiction Entirely To The Time Of Performance And Misdemeanours In The Theatres. He Would, However, Admit, Of No Abatement, And Exacted With The Utmost Rigour The Greatest Exertions Of The Wrestlers And Gladiators In Their Several Encounters. He Went So Far In Restraining The Licentiousness Of Stage-players, That Upon Discovering That Stephanio, A Performer Of The Highest Class, Had A Married Woman With Her Hair Cropped, And Dressed In Boyâ€™s Clothes, To Wait Upon Him At Table, He Ordered Him To Be Whipped Through All The Three Theatres, And Then Banished Him. Hylas, An Actor Of Pantomimes, Upon A Complaint Against Him By The Praetor, He Commanded To Be Scourged In The Court Of His Own House, Which, However, Was Open To The Public. And Pylades He Not Only Banished From The City, But From Italy Also, For Pointing With His Finger At A Spectator By Whom He Was Hissed, And Turning The Eyes Of The Audience Upon Him.</h4></div> </div>
