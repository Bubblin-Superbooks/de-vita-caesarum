He Triumphed   With His Father, Bore Jointly With Him The Office Of Censor , And Was, Besides, His Colleague Not Only In The Tribunitian Authority , But In Seven Consulships . Taking Upon Himself The Care And Inspection Of All Offices, He Dictated Letters, Wrote Proclamations In His Fatherâ€™s Name, And Pronounced His Speeches In The Senate In Place Of The Quaestor. He Likewise Assumed The Command Of The Pretorian Guards, Although No One But A Roman Knight Had Ever Before Been Their Prefect. In This He Conducted Himself With Great Haughtiness And Violence, Taking Off Without Scruple Or Delay All Those He Had Most Reason To Suspect, After He Had Secretly Sent His Emissaries Into The Theatres And Camp, To Demand, As If By General Consent, That The Suspected Persons Should Be Delivered Up To Punishment. Among These, He Invited To Supper A. Caecina, A Man Of Consular Rank, Whom He Ordered To Be Stabbed At His Departure, Immediately After He Had Gone Out Of The Room. To This Act, Indeed, He Was Provoked By An Imminent Danger; For He Had Discovered A Writing Under The Hand Of Caecina, Containing An Account Of A Plot Hatched Among The Soldiers.
