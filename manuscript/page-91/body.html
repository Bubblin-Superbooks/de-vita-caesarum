But For Deserters And Mutineers He Made The Most Diligent Enquiry, And Their Punishment Was Most Severe: Other Delinquencies He Would Connive At. Sometimes, After A Great Battle Ending In Victory, He Would Grant Them A Relaxation From All Kinds Of Duty, And Leave Them To Revel At Pleasure; Being Used To Boast, “That His Soldiers Fought Nothing The Worse For Being Well Oiled.” In His Speeches, He Never Addressed Them By The Title Of “Soldiers,” But By The Kinder Phrase Of “Fellow-soldiers;” And Kept Them In Such Splendid Order, That Their Arms Were Ornamented With Silver And Gold, Not Merely For Parade, But To Render The Soldiers More Resolute To Save Them In Battle, And Fearful Of Losing Them. He Loved His Troops To Such A Degree, That When He Heard Of The Defeat Of Those Under Titurius, He Neither Cut His Hair Nor Shaved His Beard, Until He Had Revenged It Upon The Enemy; By Which Means He Engaged Their Devoted Affection, And Raised Their Valour To The Highest Pitch.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
