Formerly, When Livia, After Her Marriage With Augustus, Was Making A Visit To Her Villa At Veii , An Eagle Flying By, Let Drop Upon Her Lap A Hen, With A Sprig Of Laurel In Her Mouth, Just As She Had Seized It. Livia Gave Orders To Have The Hen Taken Care Of, And The Sprig Of Laurel Set; And The Hen Reared Such A Numerous Brood Of Chickens, That The Villa, To This Day, Is Called The Villa Of The Hens . The Laurel Groves Flourished So Much, That The Caesars Procured Thence The Boughs And Crowns They Bore At Their Triumphs. It Was Also Their Constant Custom To Plant Others On The Same Spot, Immediately After A Triumph; And It Was Observed That, A Little Before The Death Of Each Prince, The Tree Which Had Been Set By Him Died Away. But In The Last Year Of Nero, The Whole Plantation Of Laurels Perished To The Very Roots, And The Hens All Died. About The Same Time, The Temple Of The Caesars  Being Struck With Lightning, The Heads Of All The Statues In It Fell Off At Once; And Augustusâ€™s Sceptre Was Dashed From His Hands.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
