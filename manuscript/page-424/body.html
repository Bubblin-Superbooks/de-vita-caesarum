<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Vi. His Infancy And Childhood Were Spent In The Midst Of Danger And Trouble; For He Accompanied His Parents Everywhere In Their Flight, And Twice At Naples Nearly Betrayed Them By His Crying, When They Were Privately Hastening To A Ship, As The Enemy Rushed Into The Town; Once, When He Was Snatched From His Nurse’s Breast, And Again, From His Mother’s Bosom, By Some Of The Company, Who On The Sudden Emergency Wished To Relieve The Women Of Their Burden. Being Carried Through Sicily And Achaia, And Entrusted For Some Time To The Care Of The Lacedaemonians, Who Were Under The Protection Of The Claudian Family, Upon His Departure Thence When Travelling By Night, He Ran The Hazard Of His Life, By A Fire Which, Suddenly Bursting Out Of A Wood On All Sides, Surrounded The Whole Party So Closely, That Part Of Livia’s Dress And Hair Was Burnt. The Presents Which Were Made Him  By Pompeia, Sister To Sextus Pompey, In Sicily, Namely, A Cloak, With A Clasp, And Bullae Of Gold, Are Still In Existence, And Shewn At Baiae To This Day. After His Return To The City, Being Adopted By Marcus Gallius, A Senator, In His Will, He Took Possession Of The Estate; But Soon Afterwards Declined The Use Of His Name, Because Gallius Had Been Of The Party Opposed To Augustus. When Only Nine Years Of Age, He Pronounced A Funeral Oration In Praise Of His Father Upon The Rostra; And Afterwards, When He Had Nearly Attained The Age Of Manhood, He Attended The Chariot Of Augustus, In His Triumph For The Victory At Actium, Riding On The Left-hand Horse, Whilst Marcellus, Octavia’s Son, Rode That On The Right. He Likewise Presided At The Games Celebrated On Account Of That Victory; And In The Trojan Games Intermixed With The Circensian, He Commanded A Troop Of The Biggest Boys.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
