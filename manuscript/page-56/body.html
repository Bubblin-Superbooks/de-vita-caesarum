Pursuing Him In His Flight To Alexandria, Where He Was Informed Of His Murder, He Presently Found Himself Also Engaged, Under All The Disadvantages Of Time And Place, In A Very Dangerous War, With King Ptolemy, Who, He Saw, Had Treacherous Designs Upon His Life. It Was Winter, And He, Within The Walls Of A Well-provided And Subtle Enemy, Was Destitute Of Every Thing, And Wholly Unprepared  For Such A Conflict. He Succeeded, However, In His Enterprise, And Put The Kingdom Of Egypt Into The Hands Of Cleopatra And Her Younger Brother; Being Afraid To Make It A Province, Lest, Under An Aspiring Prefect, It Might Become The Centre Of Revolt. From Alexandria He Went Into Syria, And Thence To Pontus, Induced By Intelligence Which He Had Received Respecting Pharnaces. This Prince, Who Was Son Of The Great Mithridates, Had Seized The Opportunity Which The Distraction Of The Times Offered For Making War Upon His Neighbours, And His Insolence And Fierceness Had Grown With His Success. Caesar, However, Within Five Days After Entering His Country, And Four Hours After Coming In Sight Of Him, Overthrew Him In One Decisive Battle. Upon Which, He Frequently Remarked To Those About Him The Good Fortune Of Pompey, Who Had Obtained His Military Reputation, Chiefly, By Victory Over So Feeble An Enemy. He Afterwards Defeated Scipio And Juba, Who Were Rallying The Remains Of The Party In Africa, And Pompeyâ€™s Sons In Spain.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
