When He Was Delivered From His Apprehensions, His Behaviour At First Was Unassuming, And He Did Not Carry Himself Much Above The Level Of A Private Person; And Of The Many And Great Honours Offered Him, He Accepted But Few, And Such As Were Very Moderate. His Birth-day, Which Happened To Fall At The Time Of The Plebeian Circensian Games, He With Difficulty Suffered To Be Honoured With The Addition Of Only A Single Chariot, Drawn By Two Horses. He Forbad Temples, Flamens, Or Priests To Be Appointed For Him, As Likewise The Erection Of Any Statues Or Effigies For Him, Without His Permission; And This He Granted Only On Condition That They Should Not Be Placed Amongst The Images Of The Gods, But Only Amongst The Ornaments Of Houses. He Also Interposed To Prevent The Senate From Swearing To Maintain His Acts; And The Month Of September From Being Called Tiberius, And October Being Named After Livia. The Praenomen Likewise Of Emperor, With The Cognomen Of Father Of His Country, And A Civic Crown In The Vestibule Of His House, He Would Not Accept. He Never Used The Name Of Augustus, Although He Inherited It, In Any Of His Letters, Excepting Those Addressed To Kings And Princes. Nor Had He More Than Three Consulships; One For A Few Days, Another For Three Months, And A Third, During His Absence From The City, Until The Ides [Fifteenth] Of May.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
