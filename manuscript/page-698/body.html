His Manner Of Hearing Causes Was Not To Allow Any Adjournment, But To Dispatch Them In Order As They Stood. When He Withdrew To Consult His Assessors, He Did Not Debate The Matter Openly With Them; But Silently And Privately Reading Over Their Opinions, Which They Gave Separately In Writing,  He Pronounced Sentence From The Tribunal According To His Own View Of The Case, As If It Was The Opinion Of The Majority. For A Long Time He Would Not Admit The Sons Of Freedmen Into The Senate; And Those Who Had Been Admitted By Former Princes, He Excluded From All Public Offices. To Supernumerary Candidates He Gave Command In The Legions, To Comfort Them Under The Delay Of Their Hopes. The Consulship He Commonly Conferred For Six Months; And One Of The Two Consuls Dying A Little Before The First Of January, He Substituted No One In His Place; Disliking What Had Been Formerly Done For Caninius Rebilus On Such An Occasion, Who Was Consul For One Day Only. He Allowed The Triumphal Honours Only To Those Who Were Of Quaestorian Rank, And To Some Of The Equestrian Order; And Bestowed Them Without Regard To Military Service. And Instead Of The Quaestors, Whose Office It Properly Was, He Frequently Ordered That The Addresses, Which He Sent To The Senate On Certain Occasions, Should Be Read By The Consuls.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
