After The Death Of Caesar, Upon His Return From Apollonia, As He Was Entering The City, On A Sudden, In A Clear And Bright Sky, A Circle Resembling The Rainbow Surrounded The Body Of The Sun; And, Immediately Afterwards, The Tomb Of Julia, Caesarâ€™s Daughter, Was Struck By Lightning. In His First Consulship, Whilst He Was Observing The Auguries, Twelve Vultures Presented Themselves, As They Had Done To Romulus. And When He Offered Sacrifice, The Livers Of All The Victims Were Folded Inward In The Lower Part; A Circumstance Which Was Regarded By Those Present, Who Had Skill In Things Of That Nature, As An Indubitable Prognostic Of Great And Wonderful Fortune.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
