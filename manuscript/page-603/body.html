On The Ninth Of The Calends Of February [24Th January], And About The Seventh Hour Of The Day, After Hesitating Whether He Should Rise To Dinner, As His Stomach Was Disordered By What He Had Eaten The Day Before, At Last, By The Advice Of His Friends, He Came Forth. In The Vaulted Passage Through Which He Had To Pass, Were Some Boys Of Noble Extraction, Who Had Been Brought From Asia To Act Upon The Stage, Waiting For Him In A Private Corridor, And He Stopped To See And Speak To Them; And Had Not The Leader Of The Party Said That He Was Suffering From Cold, He Would Have Gone Back, And Made Them Act Immediately. Respecting What Followed,  Two Different Accounts Are Given. Some Say, That, Whilst He Was Speaking To The Boys, Chaerea Came Behind Him, And Gave Him A Heavy Blow On The Neck With His Sword, First Crying Out, “Take This:” That Then A Tribune, By Name Cornelius Sabinus, Another Of The Conspirators, Ran Him Through The Breast. Others Say, That The Crowd Being Kept At A Distance By Some Centurions Who Were In The Plot, Sabinus Came, According To Custom, For The Word, And That Caius Gave Him “Jupiter,” Upon Which Chaerea Cried Out, “Be It So!” And Then, On His Looking Round, Clove One Of His Jaws With A Blow. As He Lay On The Ground, Crying Out That He Was Still Alive , The Rest Dispatched Him With Thirty Wounds. For The Word Agreed Upon Among Them All Was, “Strike Again.” Some Likewise Ran Their Swords Through His Privy Parts. Upon The First Bustle, The Litter Bearers Came Running In With Their Poles To His Assistance, And, Immediately Afterwards, His German Body Guards, Who Killed Some Of The Assassins, And Also Some Senators Who Had No Concern In The Affair.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
