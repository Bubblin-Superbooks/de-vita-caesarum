About The Same Time, When The Praetor Consulted Him, Whether It Was His Pleasure That The Tribunals Should Take Cognizance Of Accusations Of Treason, He Replied, “The Laws Ought To Be Put In Execution;” And He Did Put Them In Execution Most Severely. Some Person Had Taken Off The Head Of Augustus From One Of His Statues, And Replaced It By Another . The Matter Was Brought Before The Senate, And Because The Case Was Not Clear, The Witnesses Were Put To The Torture. The Party Accused Being Found Guilty, And Condemned, This Kind Of Proceeding Was Carried So Far, That It Became Capital For A Man To Beat His Slave, Or Change His Clothes, Near The Statue Of Augustus; To Carry His Head Stamped Upon The Coin, Or Cut In The Stone Of A Ring, Into A Necessary House, Or The Stews; Or To Reflect Upon Anything That Had Been Either Said Or Done By Him. In Fine, A Person Was Condemned To Death, For Suffering Some Honours To Be Decreed To Him In The Colony Where He Lived, Upon The Same Day On Which They Had Formerly Been Decreed To Augustus.</h4></div> </div>
