The Day Before He Crucified A Collector Of His Rents, He Sent For Him Into His Bed-chamber, Made Him Sit Down Upon The Bed By Him, And Sent Him Away Well Pleased, And, So Far As Could Be Inferred From His Treatment, In A State Of Perfect Security; Having Vouchsafed Him The Favour Of A Plate Of Meat From His Own Table. When He Was On The Point Of Condemning To Death Aretinus Clemens, A Man Of Consular Rank, And One Of His Friends And Emissaries, He Retained Him About His Person In The Same Or Greater Favour Than Ever; Until At Last, As They Were Riding Together In The Same Litter, Upon Seeing The Man Who Had Informed Against Him, He Said, “Are You Willing That We Should Hear This Base Slave Tomorrow?” Contemptuously Abusing The Patience Of Men, He Never Pronounced A Severe Sentence Without Prefacing It  With Words Which Gave Hopes Of Mercy; So That, At Last, There Was Not A More Certain Token Of A Fatal Conclusion, Than A Mild Commencement. He Brought Before The Senate Some Persona Accused Of Treason, Declaring, “That He Should Prove That Day How Dear He Was To The Senate;” And So Influenced Them, That They Condemned The Accused To Be Punished According To The Ancient Usage . Then, As If Alarmed At The Extreme Severity Of Their Punishment, To Lessen The Odiousness Of The Proceeding, He Interposed In These Words; For It Is Not Foreign To The Purpose To Give Them Precisely As They Were Delivered: “Permit Me, Conscript Fathers, So Far To Prevail Upon Your Affection For Me, However Extraordinary The Request May Seem, As To Grant The Condemned Criminals The Favour Of Dying In The Manner They Choose. For By So Doing, Ye Will Spare Your Own Eyes, And The World Will Understand That I Interceded With The Senate On Their Behalf.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
