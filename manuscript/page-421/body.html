He Likewise Belonged To The Family Of The Livii, By The Adoption Of His Mother’s Grandfather Into It; Which Family, Although Plebeian, Made A  Distinguished Figure, Having Had The Honour Of Eight Consulships, Two Censorships, Three Triumphs, One Dictatorship, And The Office Of Master Of The Horse; And Was Famous For Eminent Men, Particularly, Salinator And The Drusi.

Drusus Procured For Himself And His Posterity A New Surname, By Killing In Single Combat Drausus, The Enemy’s Chief. He Is Likewise Said To Have Recovered, When Pro-praetor In The Province Of Gaul, The Gold Which Was Formerly Given To The Senones, At The Siege Of The Capitol, And Had Not, As Is Reported, Been Forced From Them By Camillus.
