This Personage, Who Was King Of Armenia, He Invited To Rome By Very Liberal Promises. But Being Prevented By Unfavourable Weather From Showing Him To The People Upon The Day Fixed By Proclamation, He Took The First Opportunity Which Occurred; Several Cohorts Being Drawn Up Under Arms, About The Temples In The Forum, While He Was Seated On A Curule Chair On The Rostra, In A Triumphal Dress, Amidst The Military Standards And Ensigns. Upon Tiridates Advancing Towards Him, On A Stage Made Shelving For The Purpose, He Permitted Him To Throw Himself At His Feet, But Quickly Raised Him With His Right Hand, And Kissed Him. The Emperor Then, At The Kingâ€™s Request, Took The Turban From His Head, And Replaced It By A Crown, Whilst A Person Of Pretorian Rank Proclaimed In Latin The Words In Which The Prince Addressed The Emperor As A Suppliant. After This Ceremony, The King Was Conducted To The Theatre, Where, After Renewing His Obeisance, Nero Seated Him On His Right Hand. Being Then Greeted By Universal Acclamation With The Title Of Emperor, And Sending His Laurel Crown To The Capitol, Nero Shut The Temple Of The Two-faced Janus, As Though There Now Existed No War Throughout The Roman Empire.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
