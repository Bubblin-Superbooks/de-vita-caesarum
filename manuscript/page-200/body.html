He Then Caused All Prophetical Books, Both In Latin And Greek, The Authors Of Which Were Either Unknown, Or Of No Great Authority, To Be Brought In; And The Whole Collection, Amounting To Upwards Of Two Thousand Volumes, He Committed To The Flames, Preserving Only The Sibylline Oracles; But Not Even Those Without A Strict Examination, To Ascertain Which Were Genuine. This Being Done, He Deposited Them In Two Gilt Coffers, Under The Pedestal Of The Statue Of The Palatine Apollo. He Restored The Calendar, Which Had Been Corrected By Julius Caesar, But Through Negligence Was Again Fallen Into Confusion , To Its Former Regularity; And Upon That Occasion, Called The Month Sextilis , By His Own Name, August, Rather Than September, In Which He Was Born; Because In It He Had Obtained His First Consulship, And All His Most Considerable Victories . He Increased The Number, Dignity, And Revenues Of The Priests, And Especially Those Of The Vestal Virgins. And When, Upon The Death Of One Of Them, A New One Was To Be Taken , And Many Persons Made Interest That Their Daughters’ Names Might Be Omitted In The Lists For Election, He Replied With An Oath, “If Either Of My Own Grand-daughters Were Old Enough, I Would Have Proposed Her.”</h4></div> </div>
