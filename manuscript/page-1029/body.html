<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>I. Rhetoric, Also, As Well As Grammar, Was Not Introduced Amongst Us Till A Late Period, And With Still More Difficulty, Inasmuch As We Find That, At Times, The Practice Of It Was Even Prohibited. In Order To Leave No Doubt Of This, I Will Subjoin An Ancient Decree Of The Senate, As Well As An Edict Of The Censors:—“in The Consulship Of Caius Fannius Strabo, And Marcus Palerius Messala : The Praetor Marcus Pomponius Moved The Senate, That An Act Be Passed Respecting Philosophers And Rhetoricians. In This Matter, They Have Decreed As Follows: ‘It Shall Be Lawful For M. Pomponius, The Praetor, To Take Such Measures, And Make Such Provisions, As The Good Of The Republic, And The Duty Of His Office, Require, That No Philosophers Or Rhetoricians Be Suffered At Rome.’”</h4></div> </div>
