<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xv. His Last Victim Was Flavius Clemens , His Cousin-german, A Man Below Contempt For His Want Of Energy, Whose Sons, Then Of Very Tender Age, He Had Avowedly Destined For His Successors, And, Discarding Their Former Names, Had Ordered One To Be Called Vespasian, And The Other Domitian. Nevertheless, He Suddenly Put Him To Death Upon Some Very Slight Suspicion , Almost Before He Was Well Out Of His Consulship. By This Violent Act He Very Much Hastened His Own Destruction. During Eight Months Together There Was So Much Lightning At Rome, And Such Accounts Of The Phaenomenon Were Brought From Other Parts, That At Last He Cried Out, “Let Him Now Strike Whom He Will.” The Capitol Was Struck By Lightning, As Well As The Temple Of The Flavian Family, With The Palatine-house, And His Own Bed-chamber. The Tablet Also, Inscribed Upon The Base Of His Triumphal Statue Was Carried Away By The Violence Of The Storm, And Fell Upon A Neighbouring  Monument. The Tree Which Just Before The Advancement Of Vespasian Had Been Prostrated, And Rose Again , Suddenly Fell To The Ground. The Goddess Fortune Of Praeneste, To Whom It Was His Custom On New Year’s Day To Commend The Empire For The Ensuing Year, And Who Had Always Given Him A Favourable Reply, At Last Returned Him A Melancholy Answer, Not Without Mention Of Blood. He Dreamt That Minerva, Whom He Worshipped Even To A Superstitious Excess, Was Withdrawing From Her Sanctuary, Declaring She Could Protect Him No Longer, Because She Was Disarmed By Jupiter. Nothing, However, So Much Affected Him As An Answer Given By Ascletario, The Astrologer, And His Subsequent Fate. This Person Had Been Informed Against, And Did Not Deny His Having Predicted Some Future Events, Of Which, From The Principles Of His Art, He Confessed He Had A Foreknowledge. Domitian Asked Him, What End He Thought He Should Come To Himself? To Which Replying, “I Shall In A Short Time Be Torn To Pieces By Dogs,” He Ordered Him Immediately To Be Slain, And, In Order To Demonstrate The Vanity Of His Art, To Be Carefully Buried. But During The Preparations For Executing This Order, It Happened That The Funeral Pile Was Blown Down By A Sudden Storm, And The Body, Half-burnt, Was Torn To Pieces By Dogs; Which Being Observed By Latinus, The Comic Actor, As He Chanced To Pass That Way, He Told It, Amongst The Other News Of The Day, To The Emperor At Supper.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
