<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Ii. Lucius Plotius Gallus. Of Him Marcus Tullius Cicero Thus Writes To Marcus Titinnius : “I Remember Well That When We Were Boys, One Lucius Plotius First Began To Teach Latin; And As Great Numbers Flocked To His School, So That All Who Were Most Devoted To Study Were Eager To Take Lessons From Him, It Was A Great Trouble To Me That I Too Was Not Allowed To Do So. I Was Prevented, However, By The Decided Opinion  Of Men Of The Greatest Learning, Who Considered That It Was Best To Cultivate The Genius By The Study Of Greek.” This Same Gallus, For He Lived To A Great Age, Was Pointed At By M. Caelius, In A Speech Which He Was Forced To Make In His Own Cause, As Having Supplied His Accuser, Atracinus , With Materials For His Charge. Suppressing His Name, He Says That Such A Rhetorician Was Like Barley Bread  Compared To A Wheaten Loaf,—windy, Chaffy, And Coarse.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
