He Frequently Entertained The People With Most Magnificent And Costly Shows, Not Only In The Amphitheatre, But The Circus; Where, Besides The Usual Races With Chariots Drawn By Two Or Four Horses A-breast, He Exhibited The Representation Of An Engagement Between Both Horse And Foot, And A Sea-fight In The Amphitheatre. The People Were Also Entertained With The Chase Of Wild Beasts And The Combat Of Gladiators, Even In The Night-time, By Torch-light. Nor Did Men Only Fight In These Spectacles, But Women Also. He Constantly Attended At The Games Given By The Quaestors, Which Had Been Disused For Some Time, But Were Revived By Him; And Upon Those Occasions, Always Gave The People The Liberty Of Demanding Two Pair Of Gladiators Out Of His Own School, Who Appeared Last In Court Uniforms. Whenever He Attended The Shows Of Gladiators, There Stood At His Feet A Little Boy Dressed In Scarlet, With A Prodigiously Small Head, With Whom He Used To Talk Very Much, And Sometimes Seriously. We Are Assured, That He Was  To The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders, And Small Baskets To The Common People, And Encouraged Them To Eat By Setting Them The Example. The Day After, He Scattered Among The People A Variety Of Cakes And Other Delicacies To Be Scrambled For; And On The Greater Part Of Them Falling Amidst The Seats Of The Crowd, He Ordered Five Hundred Tickets To Be Thrown Into Each Range Of Benches Belonging To The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
