By The Pedian Law, He Was Condemned, Although Innocent, Amongst Others Who Were Concerned In The Death Of Caesar . Upon This, He Went Over To Brutus And Cassius, His Near Relations; And, After Their Death, Not Only Kept Together The Fleet, The Command Of Which Had Been Given Him Some Time Before, But Even Increased It. At Last, When The Party Had Everywhere Been Defeated, He Voluntarily Surrendered It To  Mark Antony; Considering It As A Piece Of Service For Which The Latter Owed Him No Small Obligations.
