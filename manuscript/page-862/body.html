By This Time The Forerunners Of The Enemy’s Army Had Broken Into The Palace, And Meeting With Nobody, Searched, As Was Natural, Every Corner. Being Dragged By Them Out Of His Cell, And Asked “Who He Was?” , “And If He Knew Where Vitellius Was?” He Deceived Them By A Falsehood. But At Last Being Discovered, He Begged Hard To Be Detained In Custody, Even Were It In A Prison; Pretending To Have Something To Say Which Concerned Vespasian’s Security. Nevertheless, He Was Dragged Half-naked Into The Forum, With His Hands Tied Behind Him, A Rope About His Neck, And His Clothes Torn, Amidst The Most Contemptuous Abuse, Both By Word And Deed, Along The Via Sacra; His Head Being Held Back By The Hair, In The Manner Of Condemned Criminals, And The Point Of A Sword Put Under His Chin, That He Might Hold Up His Face To Public View; Some Of The Mob, Meanwhile, Pelting Him With Dung And Mud, Whilst Others Called Him “An Incendiary And Glutton.” They Also Upbraided Him With The Defects Of His Person, For He Was Monstrously Tall, And Had A Face Usually Very Red With Hard-drinking, A Large Belly, And One Thigh Weak, Occasioned By A Chariot Running Against Him, As He Was Attending Upon Caius , While He Was Driving. At Length, Upon The Scalae Gemoniae, He Was Tormented And Put To Death In Lingering Tortures, And Then Dragged By A Hook Into The Tiber.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
