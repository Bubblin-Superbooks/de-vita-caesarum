He First Manifested Hatred Towards His Own Relations In The Case Of His Brother Drusus, Betraying Him By The Production Of A Letter To Himself, In Which Drusus Proposed That Augustus Should Be Forced To Restore The Public Liberty. In Course Of Time, He Shewed The Same Disposition With Regard To The Rest Of His Family. So Far Was He From Performing Any Office Of Kindness Or Humanity To His Wife, When She Was Banished, And, By Her Father’s Order, Confined To One Town, That He Forbad Her To Stir Out Of The House, Or Converse With Any Men. He Even Wronged Her Of The Dowry Given Her By Her Father, And Of Her Yearly Allowance, By A Quibble Of Law, Because Augustus Had Made No Provision For Them On Her Behalf In His Will. Being Harassed By His Mother, Livia, Who Claimed An Equal Share In The Government With Him, He Frequently Avoided  Seeing Her, And All Long And Private Conferences With Her, Lest It Should Be Thought That He Was Governed By Her Counsels, Which, Notwithstanding, He Sometimes Sought, And Was In The Habit Of Adopting. He Was Much Offended At The Senate, When They Proposed To Add To His Other Titles That Of The Son Of Livia, As Well As Augustus. He, Therefore, Would Not Suffer Her To Be Called “The Mother Of Her Country,” Nor To Receive Any Extraordinary Public Distinction. Nay, He Frequently Admonished Her “Not To Meddle With Weighty Affairs, And Such As Did Not Suit Her Sex;” Especially When He Found Her Present At A Fire Which Broke Out Near The Temple Of Vesta , And Encouraging The People And Soldiers To Use Their Utmost Exertions, As She Had Been Used To Do In The Time Of Her Husband.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
