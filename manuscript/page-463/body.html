But Having Now The Advantage Of Privacy, And Being Remote From The Observation Of The People Of Rome, He Abandoned Himself To All The Vicious Propensities Which He Had Long But Imperfectly Concealed, And Of Which I Shall Here Give A Particular Account From The Beginning. While A Young Soldier In The Camp, He Was So Remarkable For His Excessive Inclination To Wine, That, For Tiberius, They Called Him Biberius; For Claudius, Caldius; And For Nero, Mero. And After He Succeeded To The Empire, And Was Invested With The Office Of Reforming The Morality Of The People, He Spent A Whole Night And Two Days Together In Feasting And Drinking With Pomponius Flaccus And Lucius Piso; To One Of Whom He Immediately Gave The Province Of Syria, And To The Other The Prefecture Of The City; Declaring Them, In His Letters-patent, To Be “Very Pleasant Companions, And Friends Fit For All Occasions.” He Made An Appointment To Sup With Sestius Gallus, A Lewd And Prodigal Old Fellow, Who Had Been Disgraced By Augustus, And Reprimanded By Himself But A Few Days Before In The Senate-house; Upon Condition That He Should Not Recede In The Least From His Usual Method Of Entertainment, And That They Should Be Attended At Table By Naked Girls. He Preferred A Very Obscure Candidate For The Quaestorship, Before The Most Noble Competitors, Only For Taking Off, In Pledging Him At Table, An Amphora Of Wine At A Draught . He Presented Asellius Sabinus With Two Hundred Thousand Sesterces, For Writing A Dialogue, In The Way Of Dispute, Betwixt The Truffle And The Fig-pecker, The Oyster And The Thrush. He Likewise Instituted A New Office To Administer To His Voluptuousness, To Which He Appointed Titus Caesonius Priscus, A Roman Knight.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
