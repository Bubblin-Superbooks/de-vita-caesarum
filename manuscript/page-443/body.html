Having Summoned The Senate To Meet By Virtue Of His Tribunitian Authority, And Begun A Mournful Speech, He Drew A Deep Sigh, As If Unable To Support Himself Under His Affliction; And Wishing That Not His Voice Only, But His Very Breath Of Life, Might Fail Him, Gave His Speech To His Son Drusus To Read. Augustus’s Will Was Then Brought In, And Read By A Freedman; None Of The Witnesses To It Being Admitted, But Such As Were Of The Senatorian Order, The Rest Owning Their Hand-writing Without Doors. The Will Began Thus: “Since My Ill-fortune Has Deprived Me Of My Two Sons, Caius And Lucius, Let Tiberius Caesar Be Heir To Two-thirds Of My Estate.” These Words Countenanced The Suspicion Of Those Who Were Of Opinion, That Tiberius Was Appointed Successor More Out Of Necessity Than Choice, Since Augustus Could Not Refrain From Prefacing His Will In That Manner.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
