<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Viii. In The Administration Of Justice He Was Diligent And Assiduous; And Frequently Sat In The Forum Out Of Course, To Cancel The Judgments Of The Court Of The One Hundred, Which Had Been Procured Through Favour, Or Interest. He Occasionally Cautioned The Judges Of The Court Of Recovery To Beware Of Being Too Ready To Admit Claims For Freedom Brought Before Them. He Set A Mark Of Infamy Upon Judges Who Were Convicted Of Taking Bribes, As Well As Upon Their Assessors. He Likewise Instigated The Tribunes Of The People To Prosecute A Corrupt Aedile For Extortion, And To Desire The Senate To Appoint Judges For His Trial. He Likewise Took Such Effectual Care In Punishing Magistrates Of The City, And Governors Of Provinces, Guilty Of Malversation, That They Never Were At Any Time More Moderate Or More Just. Most Of These, Since His Reign, We Have Seen Prosecuted For Crimes Of Various Kinds. Having Taken Upon Himself The Reformation Of The Public Manners, He Restrained The Licence Of The Populace In Sitting Promiscuously With The Knights In The Theatre. Scandalous Libels, Published To Defame Persons Of Rank, Of Either Sex, He Suppressed, And Inflicted Upon Their Authors A Mark Of Infamy. He Expelled A Man Of Quaestorian Rank From The Senate, For Practising Mimicry And Dancing. He Debarred Infamous Women The Use Of Litters; As Also The Right Of Receiving Legacies, Or Inheriting Estates. He Struck Out Of The List Of Judges A Roman Knight For Taking Again His Wife Whom He Had Divorced And Prosecuted For Adultery. He Condemned Several Men Of The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders, Upon The Scantinian Law . The Lewdness Of The Vestal Virgins, Which Had Been Overlooked By His Father And Brother, He Punished Severely, But In Different Ways; Viz. Offences Committed Before His Reign, With Death, And Those Since Its Commencement, According To Ancient Custom. For To The Two Sisters Called Ocellatae, He Gave Liberty To Choose The Mode Of Death Which They Preferred, And Banished  Their Paramours. But Cornelia, The President Of The Vestals, Who Had Formerly Been Acquitted Upon A Charge Of Incontinence, Being A Long Time After Again Prosecuted And Condemned, He Ordered To Be Buried Alive; And Her Gallants To Be Whipped To Death With Rods In The Comitium; Excepting Only A Man Of Praetorian Rank, To Whom, Because He Confessed The Fact, While The Case Was Dubious, And It Was Not Established Against Him, Though The Witnesses Had Been Put To The Torture, He Granted The Favour Of Banishment. And To Preserve Pure And Undefiled The Reverence Due To The Gods, He Ordered The Soldiers To Demolish A Tomb, Which One Of His Freedmen Had Erected For His Son Out Of The Stones Designed For The Temple Of Jupiter Capitolinus, And To Sink In The Sea The Bones And Relics Buried In It.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
