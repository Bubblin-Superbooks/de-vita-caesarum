In The Saturnalia, Or At Any Other Time When The Fancy Took Him, He Distributed To His Company Clothes, Gold, And Silver; Sometimes Coins Of All Sorts, Even Of The Ancient Kings Of Rome And Of Foreign Nations; Sometimes Nothing But Towels, Sponges, Rakes, And Tweezers, And Other Things Of That Kind, With Tickets On Them, Which Were Enigmatical, And Had A Double Meaning . He Used Likewise To Sell By Lot Among His Guests Articles Of Very Unequal Value, And Pictures With Their Fronts Reversed; And So, By The Unknown Quality Of The Lot, Disappoint Or Gratify The Expectation Of The Purchasers. This Sort Of Traffic  Went Round The Whole Company, Every One Being Obliged To Buy Something, And To Run The Chance Of Loss Or Gain Wits The Rest.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
