Taking His Seat On The Tribunal, Therefore, As If There Was No Other Business Than The Manumitting Of Slaves, He Had The Effigies Of A Number Of Persons Who Had Been Condemned And Put To Death By Nero, Set Up Before Him, Whilst A Noble Youth Stood By, Who Had Been Banished, And Whom He Had Purposely Sent For From One Of The Neighbouring Balearic Isles; And Lamenting The Condition Of The Times, And Being Thereupon Unanimously Saluted By The Title Of Emperor, He Publicly Declared Himself “Only The Lieutenant Of The Senate And People Of Rome.” Then Shutting The Courts, He Levied Legions And Auxiliary Troops Among The Provincials, Besides His Veteran Army Consisting Of One Legion, Two Wings Of Horse, And Three Cohorts. Out Of The Military Leaders Most Distinguished For Age And Prudence, He Formed A Kind Of Senate, With Whom To Advise Upon All Matters Of Importance, As Often As Occasion Should Require. He Likewise Chose Several Young Men Of The Equestrian Order, Who Were To Be Allowed The Privilege Of Wearing The Gold Ring, And, Being Called “The Reserve,” Should Mount Guard Before His Bed-chamber, Instead Of The Legionary Soldiers. He Likewise Issued Proclamations Throughout The Provinces Of The Empire, Exhorting All To Rise In Arms Unanimously, And Aid The Common Cause, By All The Ways And Means In Their Power. About The Same Time, In Fortifying A Town, Which He Had Pitched Upon For A Military Post, A Ring Was Found, Of Antique Workmanship, In The Stone Of Which Was Engraved The Goddess Victory With A Trophy. Presently After, A Ship Of Alexandria Arrived At Dertosa , Loaded With Arms, Without Any Person To Steer It, Or So Much As A Single Sailor Or Passenger  On Board. From This Incident, Nobody Entertained The Least Doubt But The War Upon Which They Were Entering Was Just And Honourable, And Favoured Likewise By The Gods; When All On A Sudden The Whole Design Was Exposed To Failure. One Of The Two Wings Of Horse, Repenting Of The Violation Of Their Oath To Nero, Attempted To Desert Him Upon His Approach To The Camp, And Were With Some Difficulty Kept In Their Duty. And Some Slaves Who Had Been Presented To Him By A Freedman Of Nero’s, On Purpose To Murder Him, Had Like To Have Killed Him As He Went Through A Narrow Passage To The Bath. Being Overheard To Encourage One Another Not To Lose The Opportunity, They Were Called To An Account Concerning It; And Recourse Being Had To The Torture, A Confession Was Extorted From Them.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
