His Nursery Is Shewn To This Day, In A Villa Belonging To The Family, In The Suburbs Of Velitrae; Being A Very Small Place, And Much Like A Pantry. An Opinion Prevails In The Neighbourhood, That He Was Also Born There. Into This Place No Person Presumes To Enter, Unless Upon Necessity, And With Great Devotion, From A Belief, For A Long Time Prevalent, That Such As Rashly Enter It Are Seized With Great Horror And Consternation, Which A Short While Since Was Confirmed By A Remarkable Incident. For When A New Inhabitant Of The House Had, Either By Mere Chance, Or To Try The Truth Of The Report, Taken Up His Lodging In That Apartment, In The Course Of The Night, A Few Hours Afterwards, He Was Thrown Out By Some Sudden Violence, He Knew Not How, And Was Found In A State Of Stupefaction, With The Coverlid Of His Bed, Before The Door Of The Chamber.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
