I Say Nothing Of The Decrees Of The Senate In His Honour, Which May Seem To Have Resulted From Compulsion Or Deference. The Roman Knights Voluntarily, And With One Accord, Always Celebrated His Birth For Two Days Together; And All Ranks Of The People, Yearly, In Performance Of A Vow They Had Made, Threw A Piece Of Money Into The Curtian Lake , As An Offering For His Welfare. They Likewise, On The Calends [First] Of January, Presented For His Acceptance New-yearâ€™s Gifts In The Capitol, Though He Was Not Present With Which Donations He Purchased Some Costly Images Of The Gods, Which He Erected In Several Streets Of The City; As That Of Apollo Sandaliarius, Jupiter Tragoedus , And Others. When His House On The Palatine Hill Was Accidentally Destroyed By Fire, The Veteran Soldiers, The Judges, The Tribes, And Even The People, Individually, Contributed, According To The Ability Of Each, For Rebuilding It; But He Would  Accept Only Of Some Small Portion Out Of The Several Sums Collected, And Refused To Take From Any One Person More Than A Single Denarius . Upon His Return Home From Any Of The Provinces, They Attended Him Not Only With Joyful Acclamations, But With Songs. It Is Also Remarked, That As Often As He Entered The City, The Infliction Of Punishment Was Suspended For The Time.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
