<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Ii. Vespasian Was Born In The Country Of The Sabines, Beyond Reate, In A Little Country-seat Called Phalacrine, Upon The Fifth Of The Calends Of December [27Th November], In The Evening, In The Consulship Of Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus And Caius Poppaeus Sabinus, Five Years Before The Death Of Augustus ; And Was Educated Under The Care Of Tertulla, His Grandmother By The Father’s Side, Upon An Estate Belonging To The Family, At Cosa . After His Advancement To The Empire, He Used Frequently To Visit The Place Where He Had Spent His Infancy; And The Villa Was Continued In The Same Condition, That He Might See Every Thing About Him Just As He Had Been Used To Do. And He Had So Great A Regard For The Memory Of His Grandmother, That, Upon Solemn Occasions And Festival Days, He Constantly Drank Out Of A Silver Cup Which She Had Been Accustomed To Use. After Assuming The Manly Habit, He Had A Long Time A Distaste For The Senatorian Toga, Though His Brother Had Obtained It; Nor Could He Be Persuaded By Any One But His Mother To Sue For That Badge Of Honour. She At Length Drove Him To It, More By Taunts And Reproaches, Than By Her Entreaties  And Authority, Calling Him Now And Then, By Way Of Reproach, His Brother’s Footman. He Served As Military Tribune In Thrace. When Made Quaestor, The Province Of Crete And Cyrene Fell To Him By Lot. He Was Candidate For The Aedileship, And Soon After For The Praetorship, But Met With A Repulse In The Former Case; Though At Last, With Much Difficulty, He Came In Sixth On The Poll-books. But The Office Of Praetor He Carried Upon His First Canvass, Standing Amongst The Highest At The Poll. Being Incensed Against The Senate, And Desirous To Gain, By All Possible Means, The Good Graces Of Caius , He Obtained Leave To Exhibit Extraordinary  Games For The Emperor’s Victory In Germany, And Advised Them To Increase The Punishment Of The Conspirators Against His Life, By Exposing Their Corpses Unburied. He Likewise Gave Him Thanks In That August Assembly For The Honour Of Being Admitted To His Table.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
