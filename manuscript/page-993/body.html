<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Iv. The Appellation Of Grammarian Was Borrowed From The Greeks; But At First, The Latins Called Such Persons Literati. Cornelius Nepos, Also, In His Book, Where He Draws A Distinction Between A Literate And A Philologist, Says That In Common Phrase, Those Are Properly Called Literati Who Are Skilled In Speaking Or Writing With Care Or Accuracy, And Those More Especially Deserve The Name Who Translated The Poets, And Were Called Grammarians By The Greeks. It Appears That They Were Named Literators By Messala Corvinus, In One Of His Letters, When He Says, “That It Does Not Refer To Furius Bibaculus, Nor Even To Sigida, Nor To Cato, The Literator,”  Meaning, Doubtless, That Valerius Cato Was Both A Poet And An Eminent Grammarian. Some There Are Who Draw A Distinction Between A Literati And A Literator, As The Greeks Do Between A Grammarian And A Grammatist, Applying The Former Term To Men Of Real Erudition, The Latter To Those Whose Pretensions To Learning Are Moderate; And This Opinion Orbilius Supports By Examples. For He Says That In Old Times, When A Company Of Slaves Was Offered For Sale By Any Person, It Was Not Customary, Without Good Reason, To Describe Either Of Them In The Catalogue As A Literati, But Only As A Literator, Meaning That He Was Not A Proficient In Letters, But Had A Smattering Of Knowledge.</h4></div> </div>
