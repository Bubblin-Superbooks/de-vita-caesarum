To Mention The Most Remarkable Only, Appius Caecus Dissuaded The Senate From Agreeing To An Alliance With Pyrrhus, As Prejudicial To The Republic . Claudius Candex First Passed The Straits Of Sicily With A Fleet, And Drove The Carthaginians Out Of The Island . Claudius Nero Cut Off Hasdrubal With A Vast Army Upon His Arrival In Italy From Spain, Before He Could Form A Junction With His Brother Hannibal . On The Other Hand, Claudius Appius Regillanus, One Of The Decemvirs, Made A Violent Attempt To Have A Free Virgin, Of Whom He Was Enamoured, Adjudged A Slave; Which Caused The People To Secede A Second Time From The Senate . Claudius Drusus Erected A Statue Of Himself Wearing A Crown At Appii Forum , And Endeavoured, By Means Of His Dependants, To Make Himself Master Of Italy. Claudius Pulcher, When, Off The Coast Of Sicily , The Pullets Used For Taking Augury Would Not Eat, In Contempt Of The Omen Threw Them Overboard, As If They Should Drink At Least, If They Would Not Eat; And Then Engaging The Enemy, Was Routed. After His Defeat, When He  Was Ordered By The Senate To Name A Dictator, Making A Sort Of Jest Of The Public Disaster, He Named Glycias, His Apparitor.</h4></div> </div>
