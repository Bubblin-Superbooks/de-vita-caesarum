<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Viii. M. Pompilius Andronicus, A Native Of Syria, While He Professed To Be A Grammarian, Was Considered An Idle Follower Of The Epicurean Sect, And Little Qualified To Be A Master  Of A School. Finding, Therefore, That, At Rome, Not Only Antonius Gnipho, But Even Other Teachers Of Less Note Were Preferred To Him, He Retired To Cumae, Where He Lived At His Ease; And, Though He Wrote Several Books, He Was So Needy, And Reduced To Such Straits, As To Be Compelled To Sell That Excellent Little Work Of His, “The Index To The Annals,” For Sixteen Thousand Sesterces. Orbilius Has Informed Us, That He Redeemed This Work From The Oblivion Into Which It Had Fallen, And Took Care To Have It Published With The Author’s Name.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
