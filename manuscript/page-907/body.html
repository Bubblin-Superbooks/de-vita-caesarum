<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>C. Valerius Flaccus Wrote A Poem In Eight Books, On The Expedition Of The Argonauts; A Subject Which, Next To The Wars Of Thebes And Troy, Was In Ancient Times The Most Celebrated. Of The Life Of This Author, Biographers Have Transmitted No Particulars; But We May Place His Birth In The Reign Of Tiberius, Before All The Writers Who Flourished In The Augustan Age Were Extinct. He Enjoyed The Rays Of The Setting Sun Which Had Illumined That Glorious Period, And He Discovers The Efforts Of An Ambition To Recall Its Meridian Splendour. As The Poem Was Left  Incomplete By The Death Of The Author, We Can Only Judge Imperfectly Of The Conduct And General Consistency Of The Fable: But The Most Difficult Part Having Been Executed, Without Any Room For The Censure Of Candid Criticism, We May Presume That The Sequel Would Have Been Finished With An Equal Claim To Indulgence, If Not To Applause. The Traditional Anecdotes Relative To The Argonautic Expedition Are Introduced With Propriety, And Embellished With The Graces Of Poetical Fiction. In Describing Scenes Of Tenderness, This Author Is Happily Pathetic, And In The Heat Of Combat, Proportionably Animated. His Similes Present The Imagination With Beautiful Imagery, And Not Only Illustrate, But Give Additional Force To The Subject. We Find In Flaccus A Few Expressions Not Countenanced By The Authority Of The Most Celebrated Latin Writers. His Language, However, In General, Is Pure; But His Words Are Perhaps Not Always The Best That Might Have Been Chosen. The Versification Is Elevated, Though Not Uniformly Harmonious; And There Pervades The Whole Poem An Epic Dignity, Which Renders It Superior To The Production Ascribed To Orpheus, Or To That Of Apollonius, On The Same Subject.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
