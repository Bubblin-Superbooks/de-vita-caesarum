<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Iii. His Father Caius Octavius Was, From His Earliest Years, A Person Both Of Opulence And Distinction: For Which Reason I Am Surprised At Those Who Say That He Was A Money-dealer , And Was Employed In Scattering Bribes, And Canvassing For The Candidates At Elections, In The Campus Martius. For Being Bred Up In All The Affluence Of A Great Estate, He Attained With Ease To Honourable Posts, And Discharged The Duties Of Them With Much Distinction. After His Praetorship, He Obtained By Lot The Province Of Macedonia; In His Way To Which He Cut Off Some Banditti, The Relics Of The Armies Of Spartacus And Catiline, Who Had Possessed Themselves Of The Territory Of Thurium; Having Received From The Senate An Extraordinary Commission For That Purpose. In His Government Of The Province, He Conducted Himself With Equal Justice And Resolution; For He Defeated The Bessians And Thracians In A Great Battle, And Treated The Allies Of The Republic In Such A Manner, That There Are Extant Letters From M. Tullius Cicero, In Which He Advises And Exhorts His Brother Quintus, Who Then Held The Proconsulship Of Asia With No Great Reputation, To Imitate The Example Of His Neighbour Octavius, In Gaining The Affections Of The Allies Of Rome.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
