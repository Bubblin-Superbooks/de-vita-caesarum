But Never, With All His Endeavours, Could He Attain To Any Public Post In The Government, Or Afford Any Hope Of Arriving At Distinction Thereafter. His Mother, Antonia, Frequently Called Him “An Abortion Of A Man, That Had Been Only Begun, But Never Finished, By Nature.” And When She Would Upbraid Any One With Dulness, She Said, “He Was A Greater Fool Than Her Son, Claudius.” His Grandmother, Augusta, Always Treated Him With The Utmost Contempt, Very Rarely Spoke To Him, And When She Did Admonish Him Upon Any Occasion, It Was In Writing, Very Briefly And Severely, Or By Messengers. His Sister, Livilla, Upon Hearing That He Was About To Be Created Emperor, Openly And Loudly Expressed Her Indignation That The Roman People Should Experience A Fate So Severe And So Much Below Their Grandeur. To Exhibit The Opinion, Both Favourable And Otherwise, Entertained Concerning Him By Augustus, His Great-uncle, I Have Here Subjoined Some Extracts From The Letters Of That Emperor.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
