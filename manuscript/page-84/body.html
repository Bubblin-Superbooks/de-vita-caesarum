He Not Only Fought Pitched Battles, But Made Sudden Attacks When An Opportunity Offered; Often At The End Of A March, And Sometimes During The Most Violent Storms, When Nobody Could Imagine He Would Stir. Nor Was He Ever Backward In Fighting, Until Towards The End Of His Life. He Then Was Of Opinion, That The Oftener He Had Been Crowned With Success, The Less He Ought To Expose Himself To New Hazards; And That Nothing He Could Gain By A Victory Would Compensate For What He Might Lose By A Miscarriage. He Never Defeated The Enemy Without Driving Them From Their Camp; And Giving Them No Time To Rally Their Forces. When The Issue Of A Battle Was Doubtful, He Sent Away All The Horses, And His Own First, That Having No Means Of Flight, They Might Be Under The Greater Necessity Of Standing Their Ground.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
