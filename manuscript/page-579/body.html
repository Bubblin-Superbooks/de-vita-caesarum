He Is Said To Have Been Inflamed With An Unnatural Passion For Marcus Lepidus Mnester, An Actor In Pantomimes, And For Certain Hostages; And To Have Engaged With Them In The Practice Of Mutual Pollution. Valerius Catullus, A Young Man Of A Consular Family, Bawled Aloud In Public That He Had Been Exhausted By Him In That Abominable Act. Besides His Incest With His Sisters, And His Notorious Passion For Pyrallis, The Prostitute, There Was Hardly Any Lady Of Distinction With Whom He Did Not Make Free. He Used Commonly To Invite Them With Their Husbands To Supper, And As They Passed By The Couch On Which He Reclined At Table, Examine Them Very Closely, Like Those Who Traffic In Slaves; And If Any One From Modesty Held Down Her Face, He Raised It Up With His Hand. Afterwards, As Often As He Was In The Humour, He Would Quit The Room, Send For Her He Liked Best, And In A Short Time Return With Marks Of Recent Disorder About Them. He Would Then Commend Or Disparage Her In The Presence Of The Company, Recounting The Charms Or Defects Of Her Person And Behaviour In Private.
