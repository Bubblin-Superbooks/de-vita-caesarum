For Almost About That Very Time  Quintilius Varus Was Cut Off With Three Legions In Germany; And It Was Generally Believed That The Victorious Germans Would Have Joined The Pannonians, Had Not The War Of Illyricum Been Previously Concluded. A Triumph, Therefore, Besides Many Other Great Honours, Was Decreed Him. Some Proposed That The Surname Of “Pannonicus,” Others That Of “Invincible,” And Others, Of “O Pius,” Should Be Conferred On Him; But Augustus Interposed, Engaging For Him That He Would Be Satisfied With That To Which He Would Succeed At His Death. He Postponed His Triumph, Because  The State Was At That Time Under Great Affliction For The Disaster Of Varus And His Army. Nevertheless, He Entered The City In A Triumphal Robe, Crowned With Laurel, And Mounting A Tribunal In The Septa, Sat With Augustus Between The Two Consuls, Whilst The Senate Gave Their Attendance Standing; Whence, After He Had Saluted The People, He Was Attended By Them In Procession To The Several Temples.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
