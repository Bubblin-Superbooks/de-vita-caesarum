Being Provoked By Some Petulant Jests, Which Were Designed To Render Him Odious, He Answered Them By A Proclamation; And Yet He Prevented The Senate From Passing An Act, To Restrain The Liberties Which Were Taken With Others In People’s Wills. Whenever He Attended At The Election Of Magistrates, He Went Round The Tribes, With The Candidates Of His Nomination, And Begged The Votes Of The People In The Usual Manner.

In Building His Forum, He Restricted Himself In The Site, Not Presuming To Compel The Owners Of The Neighbouring Houses To Give Up Their Property. He Never Recommended His Sons To The People, Without Adding These Words, “If They Deserve It.” And Upon The Audience Rising On Their Entering The Theatre, While They Were Yet Minors, And Giving Them Applause In A Standing Position, He Made It A Matter Of Serious Complaint.</h4></div> </div>
