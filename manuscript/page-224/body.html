With Respect To The Army, He Distributed The Legions And Auxiliary Troops Throughout The Several Provinces, He Stationed A Fleet At Misenum, And Another At Ravenna, For The Protection Of The Upper And Lower Seas . A Certain Number Of The Forces Were Selected, To Occupy The Posts In The City, And Partly For His Own Body-guard; But He Dismissed The Spanish Guard, Which He Retained About Him Till The Fall Of Antony; And Also The Germans, Whom He Had Amongst His Guards, Until The Defeat Of Varus. Yet He Never Permitted A Greater Force Than Three Cohorts In The City, And Had No  Camps . The Rest He Quartered In The Neighbourhood Of The Nearest Towns, In Winter And Summer Camps. All The Troops Throughout The Empire He Reduced To One Fixed Model With Regard To Their Pay And Their Pensions; Determining These According To Their Rank In The Army, The Time They Had Served, And Their Private Means; So That After Their Discharge, They Might Not Be Tempted By Age Or Necessities To Join The Agitators For A Revolution. For The Purpose Of Providing A Fund Always Ready To Meet Their Pay And Pensions, He Instituted A Military Exchequer, And Appropriated New Taxes To That Object. In Order To Obtain The Earliest Intelligence Of What Was Passing In The Provinces, He Established Posts, Consisting At First Of Young Men Stationed At Moderate Distances Along The Military Roads, And Afterwards Of Regular Couriers With Fast Vehicles; Which Appeared To Him The Most Commodious, Because The Persons Who Were The Bearers Of Dispatches, Written On The Spot, Might Then Be Questioned About The Business, As Occasion Occurred.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
