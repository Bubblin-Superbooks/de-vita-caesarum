<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>M. Vipsanius Agrippa Was Of Obscure Extraction, But Rendered Himself Conspicuous By His Military Talents. He Obtained A Victory Over Sextus Pompey; And In The Battles Of Philippi And Actium, Where He Displayed Great Valour, He Contributed Not A Little To Establish The Subsequent Power Of Augustus. In His Expeditions Afterwards Into Gaul And Germany, He Performed Many Signal Achievements, For Which He Refused The Honours Of A Triumph. The Expenses Which Others Would Have Lavished On That Frivolous Spectacle, He Applied To The More Laudable Purpose Of Embellishing Rome With Magnificent Buildings, One Of Which, The Pantheon, Still Remains. In Consequence Of A Dispute With Marcellus, The Nephew Of Augustus, He Retired To Mitylene,  Whence, After An Absence Of Two Years, He Was Recalled By The Emperor. He First Married Pomponia, The Daughter Of The Celebrated Atticus, And Afterwards One Of The Marcellas, The Nieces Of Augustus. While This Lady, By Whom He Had Children, Was Still Living, The Emperor Prevailed Upon His Sister Octavia To Resign To Him Her Son-in-law, And Gave Him In Marriage His Own Daughter Julia; So Strong Was The Desire Of Augustus To Be United With Him In The Closest Alliance. The High Degree Of Favour In Which He Stood With The Emperor Was Soon After Evinced By A Farther Mark Of Esteem: For During A Visit To The Roman Provinces Of Greece And Asia, In Which Augustus Was Absent Two Years, He Left The Government Of The Empire To The Care Of Agrippa. While This Minister Enjoyed, And Indeed Seems To Have Merited, All The Partiality Of Augustus, He Was Likewise A Favourite With The People. He Died At Rome, In The Sixty-first Year Of His Age, Universally Lamented; And His Remains Were Deposited In The Tomb Which Augustus Had Prepared For Himself. Agrippa Left By Julia Three Sons, Caius, Lucius, And Posthumus Agrippa, With Two Daughters, Agrippina And Julia.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
