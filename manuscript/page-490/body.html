After Sejanus Had Plotted Against Him, Though He Saw That His Birth-day Was Solemnly Kept By The Public, And Divine Honours Paid To Golden Images Of Him In Every Quarter, Yet It Was With Difficulty At Last, And More By Artifice Than His Imperial Power, That He Accomplished His Death. In The First Place, To Remove Him From About His Person, Under The Pretext Of Doing Him Honour, He Made Him His Colleague In His Fifth Consulship; Which, Although Then Absent From The City, He Took Upon Him For That Purpose, Long After His Preceding Consulship. Then, Having Flattered Him With The Hope Of An Alliance By Marriage With One Of His Own Kindred, And The Prospect Of The Tribunitian Authority, He Suddenly, While Sejanus Little Expected It, Charged Him With Treason, In An Abject And Pitiful Address To The Senate; In Which, Among Other Things, He Begged Them “To Send One Of The Consuls, To Conduct Himself, A Poor Solitary Old Man, With A Guard Of Soldiers, Into Their Presence.” Still Distrustful, However, And Apprehensive Of An Insurrection, He Ordered His Grandson, Drusus, Whom He Still Kept In Confinement At Rome, To Be Set At Liberty, And If Occasion Required, To Head The Troops. He Had Likewise Ships In Readiness To Transport Him To Any Of The Legions To Which He Might Consider It Expedient To Make His Escape. Meanwhile, He Was Upon The  Watch, From The Summit Of A Lofty Cliff, For The Signals Which He Had Ordered To Be Made If Any Thing Occurred, Lest The Messengers Should Be Tardy. Even When He Had Quite Foiled The Conspiracy Of Sejanus, He Was Still Haunted As Much As Ever With Fears And Apprehensions, Insomuch That He Never Once Stirred Out Of The Villa Jovis For Nine Months After.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
