<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xxiv. Marcus Valerius Probus, Of Berytus , After Long Aspiring To The Rank Of Centurion, Being At Last Tired Of Waiting, Devoted Himself To Study. He Had Met With Some Old Authors At A Booksellerâ€™s Shop In The Provinces, Where The Memory Of Ancient Times Still Lingers, And Is Not Quite Forgotten, As It Is At Rome. Being Anxious Carefully To Reperuse These, And Afterwards To Make Acquaintance With Other Works Of The Same Kind, He Found Himself An Object Of Contempt, And Was Laughed  At For His Lectures, Instead Of Their Gaining Him Fame Or Profit. Still, However, He Persisted In His Purpose, And Employed Himself In Correcting, Illustrating, And Adding Notes To Many Works Which He Had Collected, His Labours Being Confined To The Province Of A Grammarian, And Nothing More. He Had, Properly Speaking, No Scholars, But Some Few Followers. For He Never Taught In Such A Way As To Maintain The Character Of A Master; But Was In The Habit Of Admitting One Or Two, Perhaps At Most Three Or Four, Disciples In The Afternoon; And While He Lay At Ease And Chatted Freely On Ordinary Topics, He Occasionally Read Some Book To Them, But That Did Not Often Happen. He Published A Few Slight Treatises On Some Subtle Questions, Besides Which, He Left A Large Collection Of Observations On The Language Of The Ancients.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
