He Was Advanced To Public Offices Before The Age At Which He Was Legally Qualified For Them; And To Some, Also, Of A New Kind, And For Life. He Seized The Consulship In The Twentieth Year Of His Age, Quartering His Legions In A Threatening Manner Near The City, And Sending Deputies To Demand It For Him In The Name Of The Army. When The Senate Demurred,  A Centurion, Named Cornelius, Who Was At The Head Of The Chief Deputation, Throwing Back His Cloak, And Shewing The Hilt Of His Sword, Had The Presumption To Say In The Senate-house, “This Will Make Him Consul, If Ye Will Not.” His Second Consulship He Filled Nine Years Afterwards; His Third, After The Interval Of Only One Year, And Held The Same Office Every Year Successively Until The Eleventh. From This Period, Although The Consulship Was Frequently Offered Him, He Always Declined It, Until, After A Long Interval, Not Less Than Seventeen Years, He Voluntarily Stood For The Twelfth, And Two Years After That, For A Thirteenth; That He Might Successively Introduce Into The Forum, On Their Entering Public Life, His Two Sons, Caius And Lucius, While He Was Invested With The Highest Office In The State. In His Five Consulships From The Sixth To The Eleventh, He Continued In Office Throughout The Year; But In The Rest, During Only Nine, Six, Four, Or Three Months, And In His Second No More Than A Few Hours. For Having Sat For A Short Time In The Morning, Upon The Calends Of January [1St January], In His Curule Chair , Before The Temple Of Jupiter Capitolinus, He Abdicated The Office, And Substituted Another In His Room. Nor Did He Enter Upon Them All At Rome, But Upon The Fourth In Asia, The Fifth In The Isle Of Samos, And The Eighth And Ninth At Tarragona.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
