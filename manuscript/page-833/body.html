But Finding Himself Disappointed, By Piso’s Being Preferred Before Him, He Turned His Thoughts To Obtaining His Purpose By The Use Of Violence; And To This He Was Instigated, As Well By The Greatness Of His Debts, As By Resentment  At Galba’s Conduct Towards Him. For He Did Not Conceal His Conviction, “That He Could Not Stand His Ground Unless He Became Emperor, And That It Signified Nothing Whether He Fell By The Hands Of His Enemies In The Field, Or Of His Creditors In The Forum.” He Had A Few Days Before Squeezed Out Of One Of The Emperor’s Slaves A Million Of Sesterces For Procuring Him A Stewardship; And This Was The Whole Fund He Had For Carrying On So Great An Enterprise. At First The Design Was Entrusted To Only Five Of The Guard, But Afterwards To Ten Others, Each Of The Five Naming Two. They Had Every One Ten Thousand Sesterces Paid Down, And Were Promised Fifty Thousand More. By These, Others Were Drawn In, But Not Many; From A Confident Assurance, That When The Matter Came To The Crisis, They Should Have Enough To Join Them.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
