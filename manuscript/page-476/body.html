Of These, After The Loss Of His Sons, He Commended Nero And Drusus, The Two Eldest Sons Of Germanicus, To The Senate; And At Their Being Solemnly Introduced Into The Forum, Distributed Money Among The People. But When He Found That On Entering Upon The New Year They Were Included In The Public Vows For His Own Welfare, He Told The Senate, “That Such Honours Ought Not To Be Conferred But Upon Those Who Had Been Proved, And Were Of More Advanced Years.” By Thus Betraying His Private Feelings Towards Them, He Exposed Them To All Sorts Of Accusations; And After Practising Many Artifices To Provoke  Them To Rail At And Abuse Him, That He Might Be Furnished With A Pretence To Destroy Them, He Charged Them With It In A Letter To The Senate; At The Same Time Accusing Them, In The Bitterest Terms, Of The Most Scandalous Vices. Upon Their Being Declared Enemies By The Senate, He Starved Them To Death; Nero In The Island Of Ponza, And Drusus In The Vaults Of The Palatium. It Is Thought By Some, That Nero Was Driven To A Voluntary Death By The Executioner’s Shewing Him Some Halters And Hooks, As If He Had Been Sent To Him By Order Of The Senate. Drusus, It Is Said, Was So Rabid With Hunger, That He Attempted To Eat The Chaff With Which His Mattress Was Stuffed. The Relics Of Both Were So Scattered, That It Was With Difficulty They Were Collected.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
