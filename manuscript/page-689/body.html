<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Vii. When He Was Yet A Mere Boy, Before He Arrived At The Age Of Puberty, During The Celebration Of The Circensian Games , He Performed His Part In The Trojan Play With A Degree Of Firmness Which Gained Him Great Applause. In The Eleventh Year Of His Age, He Was Adopted By Claudius, And Placed Under The Tuition Of Annaeus Seneca , Who Had Been Made A Senator. It Is Said, That Seneca Dreamt The Night After, That He Was Giving A Lesson To Caius Caesar . Nero Soon Verified His Dream, Betraying The Cruelty Of His Disposition In Every Way He Could. For He Attempted To Persuade His Father That His Brother, Britannicus, Was Nothing But A Changeling, Because The Latter Had  Saluted Him, Notwithstanding His Adoption, By The Name Of Aenobarbus, As Usual. When His Aunt, Lepida, Was Brought To Trial, He Appeared In Court As A Witness Against Her, To Gratify His Mother, Who Persecuted The Accused. On His Introduction Into The Forum, At The Age Of Manhood, He Gave A Largess To The People And A Donative To The Soldiers: For The Pretorian Cohorts, He Appointed A Solemn Procession Under Arms, And Marched At The Head Of Them With A Shield In His Hand; After Which He Went To Return Thanks To His Father In The Senate. Before Claudius, Likewise, At The Time He Was Consul, He Made A Speech For The Bolognese, In Latin, And For The Rhodians And People Of Ilium, In Greek. He Had The Jurisdiction Of Praefect Of The City, For The First Time, During The Latin Festival; During Which The Most Celebrated Advocates Brought Before Him, Not Short And Trifling Causes, As Is Usual In That Case, But Trials Of Importance, Notwithstanding They Had Instructions From Claudius Himself To The Contrary. Soon Afterwards, He Married Octavia, And Exhibited The Circensian Games, And Hunting Of Wild Beasts, In Honour Of Claudius.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
