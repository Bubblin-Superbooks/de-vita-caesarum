After He Became Emperor, He Had The Assurance To Boast In The Senate, “That He Had Bestowed The Empire On His Father And Brother, And They Had Restored It To Him.” And Upon Taking His Wife Again, After The Divorce, He Declared By Proclamation, “That He Had Recalled Her To His Pulvinar.”  He Was Not A Little Pleased Too, At Hearing The Acclamations Of The People In The Amphitheatre On A Day Of Festival, “All Happiness To Our Lord And Lady.” But When, During The Celebration Of The Capitoline Trial Of Skill, The Whole Concourse Of People Entreated Him With One Voice To Restore Palfurius Sura To His Place In The Senate, From Which He Had Been Long Before Expelled—he Having Then Carried Away The Prize Of Eloquence From All The Orators Who Had Contended For It,—he Did Not Vouchsafe To Give Them Any Answer, But Only Commanded Silence To Be Proclaimed By The Voice Of The Crier. With Equal Arrogance, When He Dictated The Form Of A Letter To Be Used By His Procurators, He Began It Thus: “Our Lord And God Commands So And So;” Whence It Became A Rule That No One Should  Style Him Otherwise Either In Writing Or Speaking. He Suffered No Statues To Be Erected For Him In The Capitol, Unless They Were Of Gold And Silver, And Of A Certain Weight. He Erected So Many Magnificent Gates And Arches, Surmounted By Representations Of Chariots Drawn By Four Horses, And Other Triumphal Ornaments, In Different Quarters Of The City, That A Wag Inscribed On One Of The Arches The Greek Word Axkei, “It Is Enough.”  He Filled The Office Of Consul Seventeen Times, Which No One Had Ever Done Before Him, And For The Seven Middle Occasions In Successive Years; But In Scarcely Any Of Them Had He More Than The Title; For He Never Continued In Office Beyond The Calends Of May [The 1St May], And For The Most Part Only Till The Ides Of January [13Th January]. After His Two Triumphs, When He Assumed The Cognomen Of Germanicus, He Called The Months Of September And October, Germanicus And Domitian, After His Own Names, Because He Commenced His Reign In The One, And Was Born In The Other.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
