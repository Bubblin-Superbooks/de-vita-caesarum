During His Quaestorship He Pronounced Funeral Orations From The Rostra, According To Custom, In Praise Of His Aunt  Julia, And His Wife Cornelia. In The Panegyric On His Aunt, He Gives The Following Account Of Her Own And His Father’s Genealogy, On Both Sides: “My Aunt Julia Derived Her Descent, By The Mother, From A Race Of Kings, And By Her Father, From The Immortal Gods. For The Marcii Reges , Her Mother’s Family, Deduce Their Pedigree From Ancus Marcius, And The Julii, Her Father’s, From Venus; Of Which Stock We Are A Branch. We Therefore Unite In Our Descent The Sacred Majesty Of Kings, The Chiefest Among Men, And The Divine Majesty Of Gods, To Whom Kings Themselves Are Subject.” To Supply The Place Of Cornelia, He Married Pompeia, The Daughter Of Quintus Pompeius, And Grand-daughter Of Lucius Sylla; But He Afterwards Divorced Her, Upon Suspicion Of Her Having Been Debauched By Publius Clodius. For So Current Was The Report, That Clodius Had Found Access To Her Disguised As A Woman, During The Celebration Of A Religious Solemnity , That The Senate Instituted An Enquiry Respecting The Profanation Of The Sacred Rites.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
