When Any Person Was To Be Put To The Torture, Or Criminal Punished For Parricide, He Was Impatient For The Execution, And Would Have It Performed In His Own Presence. When He Was At Tibur, Being Desirous Of Seeing An Example Of The Old Way Of Putting Malefactors To Death, Some Were Immediately Bound To A Stake For The Purpose; But There Being No Executioner To Be Had At The Place, He Sent For One From Rome, And Waited For His Coming Until Night. In Any Exhibition Of Gladiators, Presented Either By Himself Or Others, If Any Of The Combatants Chanced To Fall, He Ordered Them To Be Butchered, Especially The Retiarii, That He Might See Their Faces In The Agonies Of Death. Two Gladiators Happening To Kill Each Other, He Immediately Ordered Some Little Knives To Be Made Of Their Swords For His Own Use. He Took Great Pleasure In Seeing Men Engage With Wild Beasts, And The Combatants Who Appeared On The Stage At Noon. He Would Therefore Come To The Theatre By Break Of Day, And At Noon, Dismissing The People To Dinner, Continued Sitting Himself; And Besides Those Who Were Devoted To That Sanguinary Fate, He Would Match Others With The Beasts, Upon Slight Or Sudden Occasions; As, For Instance, The Carpenters And Their  Assistants, And People Of That Sort, If A Machine, Or Any Piece Of Work In Which They Had Been Employed About The Theatre Did Not Answer The Purpose For Which It Had Been Intended. To This Desperate Kind Of Encounter He Forced One Of His Nomenclators, Even Encumbered As He Was By Wearing The Toga.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
