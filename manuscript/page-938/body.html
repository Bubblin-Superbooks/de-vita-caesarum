Domitian Was Born Upon The Ninth Of The Calends Of November [24Th October]  , When His Father Was Consul Elect,  Power So Licentiously, That Even Then He Plainly Discovered What Sort Of Prince He Was Likely To Prove. Not To Go Into Details, After He Had Made Free With The Wives Of Many Men Of Distinction, He Took Domitia Longina From Her Husband, Aelias Lamia, And Married Her; And In One Day Disposed Of Above Twenty Offices In The City And The Provinces; Upon Which Vespasian Said Several Times, “He Wondered He Did Not Send Him A Successor Too.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
