Upon Receiving This Intelligence, He Advised The Senate To Send Thither Deputies, To Inform Them, That A Prince Had Been Already Chosen; And To Persuade Them To Peace And A Good Understanding. By Letters And Messages, However, He Offered Vitellius To Make Him His Colleague In The Empire, And His Son-in-law. But A War Being Now Unavoidable, And The Generals And Troops Sent Forward By Vitellius, Advancing, He Had A Proof Of The Attachment And Fidelity Of The Pretorian Guards, Which Had Nearly Proved Fatal To The Senatorian Order. It Had Been Judged Proper That Some Arms Should Be Given Out Of The Stores, And Conveyed To The Fleet By The Marine Troops. While They Were Employed In Fetching These From The Camp In The Night, Some Of The Guards Suspecting Treachery, Excited A Tumult; And Suddenly The Whole Body, Without Any Of Their Officers At Their Head, Ran To The Palace, Demanding That The Entire Senate Should Be Put To The Sword; And Having Repulsed Some Of The  Tribunes Who Endeavoured To Stop Them, And Slain Others, They Broke, All Bloody As They Were, Into The Banquetting Room, Inquiring For The Emperor; Nor Would They Quit The Place Until They Had Seen Him. He Now Entered Upon His Expedition Against Vitellius With Great Alacrity, But Too Much Precipitation, And Without Any Regard To The Ominous Circumstances Which Attended It. For The Ancilia  Had Been Taken Out Of The Temple Of Mars, For The Usual Procession, But Were Not Yet Replaced; During Which Interval It Had Of Old Been Looked Upon As Very Unfortunate To Engage In Any Enterprise. He Likewise Set Forward Upon The Day When The Worshippers Of The Mother Of The Gods  Begin Their Lamentations And Wailing. Besides These, Other Unlucky Omens Attended Him. For, In A Victim Offered To Father Dis , He Found The Signs Such As Upon All Other Occasions Are Regarded As Favourable; Whereas, In That Sacrifice, The Contrary Intimations Are Judged The Most Propitious. At His First Setting Forward, He Was Stopped By Inundations Of The Tiber; And At Twenty Milesâ€™ Distance From The City, Found The Road Blocked Up By The Fall Of Houses.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
