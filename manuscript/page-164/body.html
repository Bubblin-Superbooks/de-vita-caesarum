For In The Most Frequented Part Of The Town, There Was, Not Long Since, A Street Named The Octavian; And An Altar Was To Be Seen, Consecrated To One Octavius, Who Being Chosen General In A War With Some Neighbouring People, The Enemy Making A Sudden Attack, While He Was Sacrificing To Mars, He Immediately Snatched The Entrails Of The Victim From Off The Fire, And Offered Them Half Raw Upon The Altar; After Which, Marching Out To Battle, He Returned Victorious. This Incident Gave Rise To A Law, By Which It Was Enacted, That In All Future Times The Entrails Should Be Offered To Mars In The Same Manner; And The Rest Of The Victim Be Carried To The Octavii.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
