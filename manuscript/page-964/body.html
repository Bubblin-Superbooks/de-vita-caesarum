He Went To The Bath Early, And Made A Plentiful Dinner, Insomuch That He Seldom Ate More At Supper Than A Matian Apple , To Which He Added A  Draught Of Wine, Out Of A Small Flask. He Gave Frequent And Splendid Entertainments, But They Were Soon Over, For He Never Prolonged Them After Sun-set, And Indulged In No Revel After. For, Till Bed-time, He Did Nothing Else But Walk By Himself In Private.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
