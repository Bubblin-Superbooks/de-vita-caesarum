<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Vi. Aurelius Opilius , The Freedman Of Some Epicurean, First Taught Philosophy, Then Rhetoric, And Last Of All, Grammar.  Having Closed His School, He Followed Rutilius Rufus, When He Was Banished To Asia, And There The Two Friends Grew Old Together. He Also Wrote Several Volumes On A Variety Of Learned Topics, Nine Books Of Which He Distinguished By The Number And Names Of The Nine Muses; As He Says, Not Without Reason, They Being The Patrons Of Authors And Poets. I Observe That Its Title Is Given In Several Indexes By A Single Letter, But He Uses Two In The Heading Of A Book Called Pinax.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
