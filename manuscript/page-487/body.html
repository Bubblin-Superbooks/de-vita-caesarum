He Imagined That He Had Died Of A Disease Occasioned  By His Intemperance; But Finding That He Had Been Poisoned By The Contrivance Of His Wife Livilla  And Sejanus, He Spared No One From Torture And Death. He Was So Entirely Occupied With The Examination Of This Affair, For Whole Days Together, That, Upon Being Informed That The Person In Whose House He Had Lodged At Rhodes, And Whom He Had By A Friendly Letter Invited To Rome, Was Arrived, He Ordered Him Immediately To Be Put To The Torture, As A Party Concerned In The Enquiry. Upon Finding His Mistake, He Commanded Him To Be Put To Death, That He Might Not Publish The Injury Done Him. The Place Of Execution Is Still Shown At Capri, Where He Ordered Those Who Were Condemned To Die, After Long And Exquisite Tortures, To Be Thrown, Before His Eyes, From A Precipice Into The Sea. There A Party Of Soldiers Belonging To The Fleet Waited For Them, And Broke Their Bones With Poles And Oars, Lest They Should Have Any Life Left In Them. Among Various Kinds Of Torture Invented By Him, One Was, To Induce People To Drink A Large Quantity Of Wine, And Then To Tie Up Their Members With Harp-strings, Thus Tormenting Them At Once By The Tightness Of The Ligature, And The Stoppage Of Their Urine. Had Not Death Prevented Him, And Thrasyllus, Designedly, As Some Say, Prevailed With Him To Defer Some Of His Cruelties, In Hopes Of Longer Life, It Is Believed That He Would Have Destroyed Many More: And Not Have Spared Even The Rest Of His Grandchildren: For He Was Jealous Of Caius, And Hated Tiberius As Having Been Conceived In Adultery. This Conjecture Is Indeed Highly Probable; For He Used Often To Say, “Happy Priam, Who Survived All His Children!”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
