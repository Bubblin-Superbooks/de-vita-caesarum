He Always Made Three Meals A Day, Sometimes Four: Breakfast, Dinner, And Supper, And A Drunken Revel After All. This Load Of Victuals He Could Well Enough Bear, From A Custom To Which He Had Enured Himself, Of Frequently Vomiting. For These Several Meals He Would Make Different Appointments At The Houses Of His Friends On The Same Day. None Ever Entertained Him At Less Expense Than Four Hundred Thousand Sesterces . The Most Famous Was A Set Entertainment Given Him By His Brother, At Which, It Is Said, There Were Served Up No Less Than Two Thousand Choice Fishes, And Seven Thousand Birds. Yet Even This Supper He Himself Outdid, At A Feast Which He Gave Upon The First Use Of A Dish Which Had Been Made For Him, And Which, For Its Extraordinary Size, He Called “The Shield Of Minerva.” In This Dish There Were Tossed Up Together The Livers Of Char-fish, The Brains Of Pheasants And Peacocks, With The Tongues Of Flamingos, And The Entrails Of Lampreys, Which Had Been Brought In Ships Of War As Far As  From The Carpathian Sea, And The Spanish Straits. He Was Not Only A Man Of An Insatiable Appetite, But Would Gratify It Likewise At Unseasonable Times, And With Any Garbage That Came In His Way; So That, At A Sacrifice, He Would Snatch From The Fire Flesh And Cakes, And Eat Them Upon The Spot.
