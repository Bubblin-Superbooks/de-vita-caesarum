<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Lv. Those For Whom He Once Conceived A Regard, He Favoured Even To Madness. He Used To Kiss Mnester, The Pantomimic Actor, Publicly In The Theatre; And If Any Person Made The Least Noise While He Was Dancing, He Would Order Him To Be Dragged From His Seat, And Scourged Him With His Own Hand. A Roman Knight Once Making Some Bustle, He Sent Him, By A Centurion, An Order To Depart Forthwith For Ostia , And Carry A Letter From Him To King Ptolemy In Mauritania. The Letter Was Comprised In These Words: “Do Neither Good Nor Harm To The Bearer.” He Made Some Gladiators Captains Of His German Guards. He Deprived The Gladiators Called Mirmillones Of Some Of Their Arms. One Columbus Coming Off With Victory In A Combat, But Being Slightly Wounded, He Ordered Some Poison To Be Infused In The Wound, Which He Thence Called Columbinum. For Thus It Was Certainly Named With His Own Hand In A List Of Other Poisons. He Was So Extravagantly Fond Of The Party Of Charioteers Whose Colours Were Green , That He Supped And Lodged For Some Time Constantly In The Stable Where Their Horses Were Kept. At A Certain Revel, He Made A Present Of Two Millions Of Sesterces To One Cythicus, A Driver Of A Chariot. The Day Before The Circensian Games, He Used To Send His Soldiers To Enjoin Silence In The  Neighbourhood, That The Repose Of His Horse Incitatus  Might Not Be Disturbed. For This Favourite Animal, Besides A Marble Stable, An Ivory Manger, Purple Housings, And A Jewelled Frontlet, He Appointed A House, With A Retinue Of Slaves, And Fine Furniture, For The Reception Of Such As Were Invited In The Horse’s Name To Sup With Him. It Is Even Said That He Intended To Make Him Consul.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
