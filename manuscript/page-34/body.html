At The Expiration Of His Praetorship He Obtained By Lot The Farther-spain , And Pacified His Creditors, Who Were For Detaining Him, By Finding Sureties For His Debts . Contrary, However, To Both Law And Custom, He Took His Departure Before The Usual Equipage And Outfit Were Prepared. It Is Uncertain Whether This Precipitancy Arose From The Apprehension Of An Impeachment, With Which He Was Threatened On The Expiration Of His Former Office, Or From His Anxiety To Lose No Time In Relieving The Allies, Who Implored Him To Come To Their Aid.
