He So Demolished And Dispersed The Statues Of Several Illustrious Persons, Which Had Been Removed By Augustus, For Want Of Room, From The Court Of The Capitol Into The Campus Martius, That It Was Impossible To Set Them Up Again With Their Inscriptions Entire. And, For The Future, He Forbad Any Statue Whatever To Be Erected Without His Knowledge And Leave. He Had Thoughts Too Of Suppressing Homer’s Poems: “For Why,” Said He, “May Not I Do What Plato Has Done Before Me, Who Excluded Him From His Commonwealth?”  He Was Likewise Very Near Banishing The Writings And The Busts Of Virgil And Livy From All Libraries; Censuring One Of Them As “A Man Of No Genius And Very Little Learning;” And The Other As “A Verbose And Careless Historian.” He Often Talked Of The Lawyers As If He Intended To Abolish Their Profession. “By Hercules!” He Would Say, “I Shall Put It Out Of Their Power To Answer Any Questions In Law, Otherwise Than By Referring To Me!”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
