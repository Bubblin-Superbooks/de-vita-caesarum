He Conquered, However, Partly In Person, And Partly By His Lieutenants, Cantabria , Aquitania And Pannonia , Dalmatia, With All Illyricum And Rhaetia , Besides The Two Alpine Nations, The Vindelici And The Salassii . He Also Checked The Incursions Of The Dacians, By Cutting Off Three Of Their Generals With Vast Armies, And Drove The Germans Beyond The River Elbe; Removing Two Other Tribes Who Submitted, The Ubii And Sicambri, Into Gaul, And Settling Them In The Country Bordering On The Rhine. Other Nations Also, Which Broke Into Revolt, He Reduced To Submission. But He Never Made War Upon Any Nation Without Just And Necessary Cause; And Was So Far From Being Ambitious Either To Extend The Empire, Or Advance His Own Military Glory, That He Obliged The Chiefs Of Some Barbarous Tribes To Swear In The Temple Of Mars The Avenger , That They Would Faithfully Observe Their Engagements, And Not Violate The Peace Which They Had Implored. Of Some He Demanded A New Description Of Hostages, Their Women, Having Found From Experience That They Cared Little For Their Men When Given As Hostages; But He Always Afforded Them The Means Of Getting Back Their Hostages Whenever They Wished It. Even Those Who Engaged Most Frequently And With The Greatest Perfidy In Their Rebellion, He Never Punished More Severely Than By Selling Their Captives, On The Terms  Of Their Not Serving In Any Neighbouring Country, Nor Being Released From Their Slavery Before The Expiration Of Thirty Years. By The Character Which He Thus Acquired, For Virtue And Moderation, He Induced Even The Indians And Scythians, Nations Before Known To The Romans By Report Only, To Solicit His Friendship, And That Of The Roman People, By Ambassadors. The Parthians Readily Allowed His Claim To Armenia; Restoring At His Demand, The Standards Which They Had Taken From Marcus Crassus And Mark Antony, And Offering Him Hostages Besides. Afterwards, When A Contest Arose Between Several Pretenders To The Crown Of That Kingdom, They Refused To Acknowledge Any One Who Was Not Chosen By Him.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
