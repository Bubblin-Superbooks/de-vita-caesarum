One Was An Offer To Lend Gratis, For Three Years, A Hundred Millions Of Sesterces To Those Who Wanted To Borrow; And The Other, When, Some Large Houses Being Burnt Down Upon Mount Caelius, He Indemnified The Owners. To The Former Of These He Was Compelled By The Clamours Of The People, In A Great Scarcity Of Money, When He Had Ratified A Decree Of The Senate Obliging All Money-lenders To Advance Two-thirds Of Their Capital On Land, And The Debtors To Pay Off At Once The Same Proportion Of Their Debts, And It Was Found Insufficient To Remedy The Grievance. The Other He Did To Alleviate In Some Degree The Pressure Of The Times. But His Benefaction To The Sufferers By Fire, He Estimated At So High A Rate, That He Ordered The Caelian Hill To Be Called, In Future, The Augustan. To The Soldiery, After Doubling The Legacy Left Them By Augustus, He Never Gave Any Thing, Except A Thousand Denarii A Man To The Pretorian Guards, For Not Joining The Party Of Sejanus; And Some Presents To The Legions In Syria, Because They Alone Had Not Paid Reverence To The Effigies Of Sejanus Among Their Standards. He Seldom Gave Discharges To The Veteran Soldiers, Calculating  On Their Deaths From Advanced Age, And On What Would Be Saved By Thus Getting Rid Of Them, In The Way Of Rewards Or Pensions. Nor Did He Ever Relieve The Provinces By Any Act Of Generosity, Excepting Asia, Where Some Cities Had Been Destroyed By An Earthquake.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
