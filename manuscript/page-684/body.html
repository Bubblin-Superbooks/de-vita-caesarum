To Begin, Therefore, At A Remote Period, His Great-grandfather’s Grandfather, Cneius Domitius, When He Was Tribune Of The People, Being Offended With The High Priests For Electing Another Than Himself In The Room Of His Father, Obtained The  Transfer Of The Right Of Election From The Colleges Of The Priests To The People. In His Consulship , Having Conquered The Allobroges And The Arverni , He Made A Progress Through The Province, Mounted Upon An Elephant, With A Body Of Soldiers Attending Him, In A Sort Of Triumphal Pomp. Of This Person The Orator Licinius Crassus Said, “It Was No Wonder He Had A Brazen Beard, Who Had A Face Of Iron, And A Heart Of Lead.” His Son, During His Praetorship , Proposed That Cneius Caesar, Upon The Expiration Of His Consulship, Should Be Called To Account Before The Senate For His Administration Of That Office, Which Was Supposed To Be Contrary Both To The Omens And The Laws. Afterwards, When He Was Consul Himself , He Tried To Deprive Cneius Of The Command Of The Army, And Having Been, By Intrigue And Cabal, Appointed His Successor, He Was Made Prisoner At Corsinium, In The Beginning Of The Civil War. Being Set At Liberty, He Went To Marseilles, Which Was Then Besieged; Where Having, By His Presence, Animated The People To Hold Out, He Suddenly Deserted Them, And At Last Was Slain In The Battle Of Pharsalia. He Was A Man Of Little Constancy, And Of A Sullen Temper. In Despair Of His Fortunes, He Had Recourse To Poison, But Was So Terrified At The Thoughts Of Death, That, Immediately Repenting, He Took A Vomit To Throw It Up Again, And Gave Freedom To His Physician For Having, With Great Prudence And Wisdom, Given Him Only A Gentle Dose Of The Poison. When Cneius Pompey Was Consulting With His Friends In What Manner He Should Conduct Himself Towards Those Who Were Neuter And Took No Part In The Contest, He Was The Only One Who Proposed That They Should Be Treated As Enemies.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
