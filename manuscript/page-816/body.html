It Was Thought That He Likewise Intended To Reduce The Offices Held By Senators And Men Of The Equestrian Order, To A Term Of Two Yearsâ€™ Continuance; And To Bestow Them Only On Those Who Were Unwilling To Accept Them, And Had Refused Them. All The Grants Of Nero He Recalled, Saving Only The Tenth Part Of Them. For This Purpose He Gave A Commission To Fifty Roman Knights; With Orders, That If Players Or Wrestlers Had Sold What Had Been Formerly Given Them, It Should Be Exacted From The Purchasers, Since The Others, Having, No Doubt, Spent The Money, Were Not In A Condition To Pay. But On The Other Hand, He Suffered His Attendants And Freedmen To Sell Or Give Away The Revenue Of The State, Or Immunities From Taxes, And To Punish The Innocent, Or Pardon Criminals, At Pleasure. Nay, When The Roman People Were Very Clamorous For The Punishment Of Halotus And Tigellinus, Two Of The  Most Mischievous Amongst All The Emissaries Of Nero, He Protected Them, And Even Bestowed On Halotus One Of The Best Procurations In His Disposal. And As To Tigellinus, He Even Reprimanded The People For Their Cruelty By A Proclamation.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
