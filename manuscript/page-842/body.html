The Person And Appearance Of Otho No Way Corresponded To The Great Spirit He Displayed On This Occasion; For He Is Said To Have Been Of Low Stature, Splay-footed, And Bandy-legged. He Was, However, Effeminately Nice In The Care Of His Person: The Hair On His Body He Plucked Out By The Roots; And Because He Was Somewhat Bald, He Wore A Kind Of Peruke, So Exactly Fitted To His Head, That Nobody Could Have Known It For Such. He Used To Shave Every Day, And Rub His Face With Soaked Bread; The Use Of Which He Began When The Down First Appeared Upon His Chin, To Prevent His Having Any Beard. It Is Said Likewise That He Celebrated Publicly The Sacred Rites Of Isis , Clad In A Linen Garment, Such As Is Used By The Worshippers Of That Goddess. These Circumstances, I Imagine, Caused The World To Wonder The More That His Death Was So Little In Character With His Life. Many Of The Soldiers Who Were Present, Kissing And Bedewing With Their Tears His Hands And Feet As He Lay Dead, And Celebrating Him As “A Most Gallant Man, And An Incomparable Emperor,” Immediately Put An End To Their Own Lives Upon The Spot, Not Far From His Funeral Pile.</h4></div> </div>
