From This Period He Butchered, Without Distinction Or Quarter, All Whom His Caprice Suggested As Objects For His Cruelty; And Upon The Most Frivolous Pretences. To Mention Only A Few: Salvidienus Orfitus Was Accused Of Letting  Out Three Taverns Attached To His House In The Forum To Some Cities For The Use Of Their Deputies At Rome. The Charge Against Cassius Longinus, A Lawyer Who Had Lost His Sight, Was, That He Kept Amongst The Busts Of His Ancestors That Of Caius Cassius, Who Was Concerned In The Death Of Julius Caesar. The Only Charge Objected Against Paetus Thrasea Was, That He Had A Melancholy Cast Of Features, And Looked Like A Schoolmaster. He Allowed But One Hour To Those Whom He Obliged To Kill Themselves; And, To Prevent Delay, He Sent Them Physicians “To Cure Them Immediately, If They Lingered Beyond That Time;” For So He Called Bleeding Them To Death. There Was At That Time An Egyptian Of A Most Voracious Appetite, Who Would Digest Raw Flesh, Or Any Thing Else That Was Given Him. It Was Credibly Reported, That The Emperor Was Extremely Desirous Of Furnishing Him With Living Men To Tear And Devour. Being Elated With His Great Success In The Perpetration Of Crimes, He Declared, “That No Prince Before Himself Ever Knew The Extent Of His Power.” He Threw Out Strong Intimations That He Would Not Even Spare The Senators Who Survived, But Would Entirely Extirpate That Order, And Put The Provinces And Armies Into The Hands Of The Roman Knights And His Own Freedmen. It Is Certain That He Never Gave Or Vouchsafed To Allow Any One The Customary Kiss, Either On Entering Or Departing, Or Even Returned A Salute. And At The Inauguration Of A Work, The Cut Through The Isthmus , He, With A Loud Voice, Amidst The Assembled Multitude, Uttered A Prayer, That “The Undertaking Might Prove Fortunate For Himself And The Roman People,” Without Taking The Smallest Notice Of The Senate.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
