Persons Were Often Put To The Torture In His Presence, Whilst He Was Dining Or Carousing. A Soldier, Who Was An Adept In The Art Of Beheading, Used At Such Times To Take Off The Heads Of Prisoners, Who Were Brought In For That Purpose. At Puteoli, At The Dedication Of The Bridge Which He Planned, As Already Mentioned , He Invited A Number Of People To Come To Him From The Shore, And Then Suddenly, Threw Them Headlong Into The Sea; Thrusting Down With Poles And Oars Those Who, To Save Themselves, Had Got Hold Of The Rudders Of The Ships. At Rome, In A Public Feast, A Slave Having Stolen Some Thin Plates Of Silver With Which The Couches Were Inlaid, He Delivered Him Immediately To An Executioner, With Orders To Cut Off His Hands, And Lead Him Round The Guests, With Them Hanging From His Neck Before His Breast, And A Label, Signifying The Cause Of His Punishment. A Gladiator Who Was Practising With Him, And Voluntarily Threw Himself At His Feet, He Stabbed With A Poniard, And Then Ran About With A Palm Branch In His Hand, After The Manner Of Those Who Are Victorious In The Games. When A Victim Was To Be Offered Upon An Altar, He, Clad In The Habit Of The Popae , And Holding The Axe Aloft For A While, At Last, Instead Of The Animal, Slaughtered An Officer Who Attended To Cut Up The Sacrifice. And At A Sumptuous Entertainment, He Fell Suddenly Into A Violent Fit Of Laughter, And Upon The Consuls, Who Reclined Next To Him, Respectfully Asking Him The Occasion, “Nothing,” Replied He, “But That, Upon A Single Nod Of Mine, You Might Both Have Your Throats Cut.”</h4></div> </div>
