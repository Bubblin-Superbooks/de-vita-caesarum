<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Vi. Nero Was Born At Antium, Nine Months After The Death Of Tiberius , Upon The Eighteenth Of The Calends Of January [15Th December], Just As The Sun Rose, So That Its Beams Touched Him Before They Could Well Reach The Earth. While Many Fearful Conjectures, In Respect To His Future Fortune, Were Formed By Different Persons, From The Circumstances Of His Nativity, A Saying Of His Father, Domitius, Was Regarded As An Ill Presage, Who Told His Friends Who Were Congratulating Him Upon The Occasion, “That Nothing But What Was Detestable, And Pernicious To The Public, Could Ever Be Produced Of Him And Agrippina.” Another Manifest Prognostic Of His Future Infelicity Occurred Upon His Lustration Day . For Caius Caesar Being Requested By His Sister To Give The Child What Name He Thought Proper—looking At His Uncle, Claudius, Who  Afterwards, When Emperor, Adopted Nero, He Gave His: And This Not Seriously, But Only In Jest; Agrippina Treating It With Contempt, Because Claudius At That Time Was A Mere Laughing-stock At The Palace. He Lost His Father When He Was Three Years Old, Being Left Heir To A Third Part Of His Estate; Of Which He Never Got Possession, The Whole Being Seized By His Co-heir, Caius. His Mother Being Soon After Banished, He Lived With His Aunt Lepida, In A Very Necessitous Condition, Under The Care Of Two Tutors, A Dancing-master And A Barber. After Claudius Came To The Empire, He Not Only Recovered His Father’s Estate, But Was Enriched With The Additional Inheritance Of That Of His Step-father, Crispus Passienus. Upon His Mother’s Recall From Banishment, He Was Advanced To Such Favour, Through Nero’s Powerful Interest With The Emperor, That It Was Reported, Assassins Were Employed By Messalina, Claudius’s Wife, To Strangle Him, As Britannicus’s Rival, Whilst He Was Taking His Noon-day Repose. In Addition To The Story, It Was Said That They Were Frightened By A Serpent, Which Crept From Under His Cushion, And Ran Away. The Tale Was Occasioned By Finding On His Couch, Near The Pillow, The Skin Of A Snake, Which, By His Mother’s Order, He Wore For Some Time Upon His Right Arm, Inclosed In A Bracelet Of Gold. This Amulet, At Last, He Laid Aside, From Aversion To Her Memory; But He Sought For It Again, In Vain, In The Time Of His Extremity.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
