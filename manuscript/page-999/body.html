<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Vii. Marcus Antonius Gnipho , A Free-born Native Of Gaul, Was Exposed In His Infancy, And Afterwards Received His Freedom From His Foster-father; And, As Some Say, Was Educated At Alexandria, Where Dionysius Scytobrachion  Was His Fellow Pupil. This, However, I Am Not Very Ready To Believe, As The Times At Which They Flourished Scarcely Agree. He Is Said To Have Been A Man Of Great Genius, Of Singular Memory, Well Read In Greek As Well As Latin, And Of A Most Obliging And Agreeable Temper, Who Never Haggled About Remuneration, But Generally Left It To The Liberality Of His Scholars. He First Taught In The House Of Julius Caesar , When The Latter Was Yet But A Boy, And, Afterwards, In His Own Private House. He Gave Instruction In Rhetoric Also, Teaching The Rules Of Eloquence Every Day, But Declaiming Only On Festivals. It Is Said That Some Very Celebrated Men Frequented His School,—and, Among Others, Marcus Cicero, During The Time He Held The Praetorship . He Wrote A Number Of Works, Although He Did Not Live Beyond His Fiftieth Year; But Atteius, The Philologist , Says, That He Left Only Two Volumes, “De Latino Sermone;” And, That The Other Works Ascribed To Him, Were Composed By His Disciples, And Were Not His, Although His Name Is Sometimes To Be Found In Them.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
