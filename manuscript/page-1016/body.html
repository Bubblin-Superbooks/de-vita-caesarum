<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xvii. Verrius Flaccus , A Freedman, Distinguished Himself By A New Mode Of Teaching; For It Was His Practice To Exercise The Wits Of His Scholars, By Encouraging Emulation Among Them; Not Only Proposing The Subjects On Which They Were To Write, But Offering Rewards For Those Who Were Successful In The Contest. These Consisted Of Some Ancient, Handsome, Or Rare Book. Being, In Consequence, Selected By Augustus, As Preceptor To His Grandsons, He Transferred His Entire School To The Palatium, But With The Understanding That He Should Admit No Fresh Scholars. The Hall In Catilineâ€™s House,  Which Had Then Been Added To The Palace, Was Assigned Him For His School, With A Yearly Allowance Of One Hundred Thousand Sesterces. He Died Of Old Age, In The Reign Of Tiberius. There Is A Statue Of Him At Praeneste, In The Semi-circle At The Lower Side Of The Forum, Where He Had Set Up Calendars Arranged By Himself, And Inscribed On Slabs Of Marble.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
