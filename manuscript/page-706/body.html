He Had From His Childhood An Extravagant Passion For Horses; And His Constant Talk Was Of The Circensian Races, Notwithstanding It Was Prohibited Him. Lamenting Once, Among His Fellow-pupils, The Case Of A Charioteer Of The Green Party, Who Was Dragged Round The Circus At The Tail Of His Chariot, And Being Reprimanded By His Tutor For It, He Pretended That He Was Talking Of Hector. In The Beginning Of His Reign, He Used To Amuse Himself Daily With Chariots Drawn By Four Horses, Made Of Ivory, Upon A Table. He Attended At All The Lesser Exhibitions In The Circus, At First Privately, But At Last Openly; So That Nobody Ever Doubted Of His Presence On Any Particular Day. Nor Did He Conceal His Desire To Have The Number Of The Prizes Doubled; So That The Races Being Increased Accordingly, The Diversion Continued Until A Late Hour; The Leaders Of Parties Refusing Now To Bring Out Their Companies For Any Time Less Than The Whole Day. Upon This, He Took A Fancy For Driving The Chariot Himself, And That Even Publicly. Having Made His First Experiment In The Gardens, Amidst Crowds Of Slaves And Other Rabble, He At Length Performed In The View Of All The People, In The Circus Maximus, Whilst One Of His Freedmen Dropped The Napkin In The Place Where The Magistrates Used To Give The Signal. Not Satisfied With Exhibiting Various Specimens Of His Skill In Those Arts At Rome, He Went Over To Achaia, As Has Been Already Said, Principally For This Purpose. The Several Cities, In Which Solemn Trials Of Musical Skill Used To Be Publicly Held, Had Resolved To Send Him The Crowns Belonging To Those Who Bore Away The Prize. These He Accepted So Graciously, That He Not Only Gave The Deputies Who Brought Them An Immediate Audience, But Even Invited Them To His Table. Being Requested By Some Of Them To Sing At Supper, And Prodigiously Applauded, He Said, “The Greeks Were The Only People Who Has An Ear For Music, And Were The Only Good Judges Of Him And His Attainments.” Without Delay He Commenced His Journey, And On His Arrival At Cassiope ,  Exhibited His First Musical Performance Before The Altar Of Jupiter Cassius.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
