For Not Satisfied With Reviving The Imposts Which Had Been Repealed In The Time Of Galba, He Imposed New And Onerous Taxes, Augmented The Tribute Of The Provinces, And Doubled That Of Some Of Them. He Likewise Openly Engaged In A Traffic, Which Is Discreditable  Even To A Private Individual, Buying Great Quantities Of Goods, For The Purpose Of Retailing Them Again To Advantage. Nay, He Made No Scruple Of Selling The Great Offices Of The State To Candidates, And Pardons To Persons Under Prosecution, Whether They Were Innocent Or Guilty. It Is Believed, That He Advanced All The Most Rapacious Amongst The Procurators To Higher Offices, With The View Of Squeezing Them After They Had Acquired Great Wealth. He Was Commonly Said, “To Have Used Them As Sponges,” Because It Was His Practice, As We May Say, To Wet Them When Dry, And Squeeze Them When Wet. It Is Said That He Was Naturally Extremely Covetous, And Was Upbraided With It By An Old Herdsman Of His, Who, Upon The Emperor’s Refusing To Enfranchise Him Gratis, Which On His Advancement He Humbly Petitioned For, Cried Out, “That The Fox Changed His Hair, But Not His Nature.” On The Other Hand, Some Are Of Opinion, That He Was Urged To His Rapacious Proceedings By Necessity, And The Extreme Poverty Of The Treasury And Exchequer, Of Which He Took Public Notice In The Beginning Of His Reign; Declaring That “No Less Than Four Hundred Thousand Millions Of Sesterces Were Wanting To Carry On The Government.” This Is The More Likely To Be True, Because He Applied To The Best Purposes What He Procured By Bad Means.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
