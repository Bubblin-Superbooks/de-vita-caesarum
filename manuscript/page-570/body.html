Asking A Certain Person, Whom He Recalled After A Long Exile, How He Used To Spend His Time, He Replied, With Flattery, “I Was Always Praying The Gods For What Has Happened, That Tiberius Might Die, And You Be Emperor.” Concluding, Therefore, That Those He Had Himself Banished Also  Prayed For His Death, He Sent Orders Round The Islands  To Have Them All Put To Death. Being Very Desirous To Have A Senator Torn To Pieces, He Employed Some Persons To Call Him A Public Enemy, Fall Upon Him As He Entered The Senate-house, Stab Him With Their Styles, And Deliver Him To The Rest To Tear Asunder. Nor Was He Satisfied, Until He Saw The Limbs And Bowels Of The Man, After They Had Been Dragged Through The Streets, Piled Up In A Heap Before Him.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
