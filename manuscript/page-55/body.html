He Took Possession Of Picenum, Umbria, And Etruria; And Having Obliged Lucius Domitius, Who Had Been Tumultuously Nominated His Successor, And Held Corsinium With A Garrison, To Surrender, And Dismissed Him, He Marched Along The Coast Of The Upper Sea, To Brundusium, To Which Place The Consuls And Pompey Were Fled With The Intention Of Crossing The Sea As Soon As Possible. After Vain Attempts, By All The Obstacles He Could Oppose, To Prevent Their Leaving The Harbour, He Turned His Steps Towards Rome, Where He Appealed To The Senate On The Present State Of Public Affairs; And Then Set Out For Spain, In Which Province Pompey Had A Numerous Army, Under The Command Of Three Lieutenants, Marcus Petreius, Lucius Afranius, And Marcus Varro; Declaring Amongst His Friends, Before He Set Forward, “That He Was Going Against An Army Without A General, And Should Return Thence Against A General Without An Army.” Though His Progress Was Retarded Both By The Siege Of Marseilles, Which Shut Her Gates Against Him, And A Very Great Scarcity Of Corn, Yet In A Short Time He Bore Down All Before Him.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
