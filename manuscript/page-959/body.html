<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xvii. Concerning The Contrivance And Mode Of His Death, The Common Account Is This. The Conspirators Being In Some Doubt When And Where They Should Attack Him, Whether While He Was In The Bath, Or At Supper, Stephanus, A Steward Of Domitilla’s , Then Under Prosecution For Defrauding His Mistress, Offered Them His Advice And Assistance; And Wrapping Up His Left Arm, As If It Was Hurt, In Wool And Bandages For Some Days, To Prevent Suspicion, At The Hour Appointed, He Secreted A Dagger In Them. Pretending Then To Make A Discovery Of A Conspiracy, And Being For That Reason Admitted, He Presented To The Emperor A Memorial, And While He Was Reading It In Great Astonishment, Stabbed Him In The Groin. But Domitian, Though Wounded, Making Resistance, Clodianus, One Of His Guards, Maximus, A Freedman Of Parthenius’s, Saturius, His Principal Chamberlain, With Some Gladiators, Fell Upon Him, And Stabbed Him In Seven Places. A Boy Who Had The Charge Of The Lares In His Bed-chamber, And Was Then In Attendance As Usual, Gave These Further Particulars: That He Was Ordered By Domitian, Upon Receiving His First Wound, To Reach Him A Dagger Which Lay Under His Pillow, And Call In His Domestics; But That He Found Nothing At The Head Of The Bed, Excepting The Hilt Of A  Poniard, And That All The Doors Were Fastened: That The Emperor In The Mean Time Got Hold Of Stephanus, And Throwing Him Upon The Ground, Struggled A Long Time With Him; One While Endeavouring To Wrench The Dagger From Him, Another While, Though His Fingers Were Miserably Mangled, To Tear Out His Eyes. He Was Slain Upon The Fourteenth Of The Calends Of October [18Th Sept.], In The Forty-fifth Year Of His Age, And The Fifteenth Of His Reign . His Corpse Was Carried Out Upon A Common Bier By The Public Bearers, And Buried By His Nurse Phyllis, At His Suburban Villa On The Latin Way. But She Afterwards Privately Conveyed His Remains To The Temple Of The Flavian Family , And Mingled Them With The Ashes Of Julia, The Daughter Of Titus, Whom She Had Also Nursed.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
