<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xv. Lenaeus Was A Freedman Of Pompey The Great, And Attended Him In Most Of His Expeditions. On The Death Of His Patron And His Sons, He Supported Himself By Teaching In A School Which He Opened Near The Temple Of Tellus, In The Carium, In The Quarter Of The City Where The House Of The Pompeys Stood . Such Was His Regard For His Patron’s Memory, That When Sallust Described Him As Having A Brazen Face, And A Shameless Mind, He Lashed The Historian In A Most Bitter Satire , As “A Bull’s-pizzle, A Gormandizer, A Braggart, And A Tippler, A Man Whose Life And Writings Were Equally Monstrous;” Besides Charging Him With Being “A Most Unskilful Plagiarist, Who Borrowed The Language Of Cato And Other Old Writers.” It Is Related, That, In His Youth, Having Escaped From Slavery By The Contrivance Of Some Of His Friends, He Took Refuge In His Own Country; And, That After He Had Applied Himself To The Liberal Arts, He Brought The Price Of His Freedom To His Former Master, Who, However, Struck By His Talents And Learning, Gave Him Manumission Gratuitously.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
