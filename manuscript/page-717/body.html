He Began The Practice Of Parricide And Murder With Claudius Himself; For Although He Was Not The Contriver Of His Death, He Was Privy To The Plot. Nor Did He Make Any Secret Of It; But Used Afterwards To Commend, In A Greek Proverb, Mushrooms As Food Fit For The Gods, Because Claudius Had Been Poisoned With Them. He Traduced His Memory Both By Word And Deed In The Grossest Manner; One While Charging Him With Folly, Another While With Cruelty. For He Used To Say By Way Of Jest, That He Had Ceased Morari  Amongst Men, Pronouncing The First Syllable Long; And Treated As Null Many Of His Decrees And Ordinances, As Made By A Doting Old Blockhead. He Enclosed The Place Where His Body Was Burnt With Only A Low Wall Of Rough Masonry. He Attempted To Poison  Britannicus, As Much Out Of Envy Because He Had A Sweeter Voice, As From Apprehension Of What Might Ensue From The Respect Which The People Entertained For His Father’s Memory. He Employed For This Purpose A Woman Named Locusta, Who Had Been A Witness Against Some Persons Guilty Of Like Practices. But The Poison She Gave Him, Working More Slowly Than He Expected, And Only Causing A Purge, He Sent For The Woman, And Beat Her With His Own Hand, Charging Her With Administering An Antidote Instead Of Poison; And Upon Her Alleging In Excuse, That She Had Given Britannicus But A Gentle Mixture In Order To Prevent Suspicion, “Think You,” Said He, “That I Am Afraid Of The Julian Law;” And Obliged Her To Prepare, In His Own Chamber And Before His Eyes, As Quick And Strong A Dose As Possible. This He Tried Upon A Kid: But The Animal Lingering For Five Hours Before It Expired, He Ordered Her To Go To Work Again; And When She Had Done, He Gave The Poison To A Pig, Which Dying Immediately, He Commanded The Potion To Be Brought Into The Eating-room And Given To Britannicus, While He Was At Supper With Him. The Prince Had No Sooner Tasted It Than He Sunk On The Floor, Nero Meanwhile, Pretending To The Guests, That It Was Only A Fit Of The Falling Sickness, To Which, He Said, He Was Subject. He Buried Him The Following Day, In A Mean And Hurried Way, During Violent Storms Of Rain. He Gave Locusta A Pardon, And Rewarded Her With A Great Estate In Land, Placing Some Disciples With Her, To Be Instructed In Her Trade.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
