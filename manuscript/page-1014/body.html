<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xvi. Quintus Caecilius, An Epirot By Descent, But Born At Tusculum, Was A Freedman Of Atticus Satrius, A Roman  Knight, To Whom Cicero Addressed His Epistles . He Became The Tutor Of His Patronâ€™s Daughter , Who Was Contracted To Marcus Agrippa, But Being Suspected Of An Illicit Intercourse With Her, And Sent Away On That Account, He Betook Himself To Cornelius Gallus, And Lived With Him On Terms Of The Greatest Intimacy, Which, Indeed, Was Imputed To Gallus As One Of His Heaviest Offences, By Augustus. Then, After The Condemnation And Death Of Gallus , He Opened A School, But Had Few Pupils, And Those Very Young, Nor Any Belonging To The Higher Orders, Excepting The Children Of Those He Could Not Refuse To Admit. He Was The First, It Is Said, Who Held Disputations In Latin, And Who Began To Lecture On Virgil And The Other Modern Poets; Which The Verse Of Domitius Marcus  Points Out.</h4></div> </div>
