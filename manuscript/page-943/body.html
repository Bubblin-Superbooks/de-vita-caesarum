That Against The Catti  Was Unprovoked, But That Against The Sarmatians Was Necessary; An Entire Legion, With Its Commander, Having Been Cut Off By Them. He Sent Two Expeditions Against The Dacians; The First Upon The Defeat Of Oppius Sabinus, A Man Of Consular Rank; And  The Other, Upon That Of Cornelius Fuscus, Prefect Of The Pretorian Cohorts, To Whom He Had Entrusted The Conduct Of That War. After Several Battles With The Catti And Daci, He Celebrated A Double Triumph. But For His Successes Against The Sarmatians, He Only Bore In Procession The Laurel Crown To Jupiter Capitolinus. The Civil War, Begun By Lucius Antonius, Governor Of Upper Germany, He Quelled, Without Being Obliged To Be Personally Present At It, With Remarkable Good Fortune. For, At The Very Moment Of Joining Battle, The Rhine Suddenly Thawing, The Troops Of The Barbarians Which Were Ready To Join L. Antonius, Were Prevented From Crossing The River. Of This Victory He Had Notice By Some Presages, Before The Messengers Who Brought The News Of It Arrived. For Upon The Very Day The Battle Was Fought, A Splendid Eagle Spread Its Wings Round His Statue At Rome, Making Most Joyful Cries. And Shortly After, A Rumour Became Common, That Antonius Was Slain; Nay, Many Positively Affirmed, That They Saw His Head Brought To The City.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
