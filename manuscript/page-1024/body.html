<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xxiii. Remmius Palaemon , Of Vicentia , The Offspring Of A Bond-woman, Acquired The Rudiments Of Learning, First As The Companion Of A Weaver’s, And Then Of His Master’s, Son, At School. Being Afterwards Made Free, He Taught At Rome, Where He Stood Highest In The Rank Of The Grammarians; But He Was So Infamous For Every Sort Of Vice, That Tiberius And His Successor Claudius Publicly Denounced Him As An Improper Person To Have The Education Of Boys And Young Men Entrusted To Him. Still, His Powers Of Narrative And Agreeable Style Of Speaking Made Him Very Popular; Besides Which, He Had The Gift Of Making Extempore Verses. He Also Wrote A Great Many In  Various And Uncommon Metres. His Insolence Was Such, That He Called Marcus Varro “A Hog;” And Bragged That “Letters Were Born And Would Perish With Him;” And That “His Name Was Not Introduced Inadvertently In The Bucolics , As Virgil Divined That A Palaemon Would Some Day Be The Judge Of All Poets And Poems.” He Also Boasted, That Having Once Fallen Into The Hands Of Robbers, They Spared Him On Account Of The Celebrity His Name Had Acquired.</h4></div> </div>
