In Every Town Through Which He Passed In His Way From Spain To Rome, Victims Were Slain On The Right And Left Of The Roads; And One Of These, Which Was A Bull, Being Maddened With The Stroke Of The Axe, Broke The Rope With Which It Was Tied, And Running Straight Against His Chariot, With His Fore-feet Elevated, Bespattered Him With Blood. Likewise, As He Was Alighting, One Of The Guard, Being Pushed Forward By The Crowd, Had Very Nearly Wounded Him With His Lance. And Upon His Entering The City And, Afterwards, The Palace, He Was Welcomed With An Earthquake, And A Noise Like The Bellowing Of Cattle. These Signs Of Ill-fortune Were Followed By Some That Were Still More Apparently Such. Out Of All His Treasures He Had Selected A Necklace Of Pearls And Jewels, To Adorn His Statue Of Fortune At Tusculum. But It Suddenly Occurring To Him That It Deserved A More August Place, He Consecrated It To The Capitoline Venus; And Next Night, He Dreamt That Fortune Appeared To Him, Complaining That She Had Been Defrauded Of The Present Intended Her, And Threatening To Resume What She Had Given Him. Terrified At This Denunciation, At Break Of Day He Sent Forward Some Persons To Tusculum, To Make Preparations For A Sacrifice Which Might Avert The Displeasure Of The Goddess; And When He Himself Arrived At The Place, He Found Nothing But Some Hot Embers Upon The Altar, And An Old Man In Black Standing By, Holding A Little Incense In A Glass, And Some Wine In An Earthern Pot. It Was Remarked, Too, That Whilst He Was Sacrificing Upon The Calends Of January, The Chaplet Fell From His Head, And Upon His Consulting The Pullets For Omens, They Flew Away. Farther, Upon The Day Of His Adopting Piso, When He Was To Harangue The Soldiers, The Seat Which He Used Upon Those Occasions, Through The Neglect Of His Attendants, Was Not Placed, According To Custom, Upon His Tribunal; And In The Senate-house, His Curule Chair Was Set With The Back Forward.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
