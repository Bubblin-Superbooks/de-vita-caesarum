Married Women Guilty Of Adultery, Though Not Prosecuted Publicly, He Authorised The Nearest Relations To Punish By Agreement Among Themselves, According To Ancient Custom. He Discharged A Roman Knight From The Obligation Of An Oath He Had Taken, Never To Turn Away His Wife; And Allowed Him To Divorce Her, Upon Her Being Caught In Criminal Intercourse With Her Son-in-law. Women Of Ill-fame, Divesting Themselves Of The Rights And Dignity Of Matrons, Had Now Begun A Practice Of Professing Themselves Prostitutes, To Avoid  The Punishment Of The Laws; And The Most Profligate Young Men Of The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders, To Secure Themselves Against A Decree Of The Senate, Which Prohibited Their Performing On The Stage, Or In The Amphitheatre, Voluntarily Subjected Themselves To An Infamous Sentence, By Which They Were Degraded. All Those He Banished, That None For The Future Might Evade By Such Artifices The Intention And Efficacy Of The Law. He Stripped A Senator Of The Broad Stripes On His Robe, Upon Information Of His Having Removed To His Gardens Before The Calends [The First] Of July, In Order That He Might Afterwards Hire A House Cheaper In The City. He Likewise Dismissed Another From The Office Of Quaestor, For Repudiating, The Day After He Had Been Lucky In Drawing His Lot, A Wife Whom He Had Married Only The Day Before.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
