Some Have Imagined That Tiberius Was Born At Fundi, But There Is Only This Trifling Foundation For The Conjecture, That His Motherâ€™s Grandmother Was Of Fundi, And That The Image Of Good Fortune Was, By A Decree Of The Senate, Erected In A Public Place In That Town. But According To The Greatest Number Of Writers, And Those Too Of The Best Authority, He Was Born At Rome, In The Palatine Quarter, Upon The Sixteenth Of The Calends Of December [16Th Nov.], When Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Was Second Time Consul, With Lucius Munatius Plancus , After The Battle Of Philippi; For So It Is Registered In The Calendar, And The Public Acts. According To Some, However, He Was Born The Preceding Year, In The Consulship Of Hirtius And Pansa; And Others Say, In The Year Following, During The Consulship Of Servilius Isauricus And Antony.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
