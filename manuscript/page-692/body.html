To Establish Still Further His Character, He Declared, “That He Designed To Govern According To The Model Of Augustus;” And Omitted No Opportunity Of Showing His Generosity, Clemency, And Complaisance. The More Burthensome Taxes He Either Entirely Took Off, Or Diminished. The Rewards Appointed For Informers By The Papian Law, He Reduced To A Fourth Part, And Distributed To The People Four Hundred Sesterces A Man. To The Noblest Of The Senators Who Were Much Reduced In Their Circumstances, He Granted Annual Allowances, In Some Cases As Much As Five Hundred Thousand Sesterces; And To The Pretorian Cohorts A Monthly Allowance Of Corn Gratis. When Called Upon To Subscribe The Sentence, According To Custom, Of A Criminal Condemned To Die, “I Wish,” Said He, “I Had Never Learnt To Read And Write.” He Continually Saluted People Of The Several Orders By Name, Without A Prompter. When The Senate Returned Him Their Thanks For His Good Government, He Replied To Them, “It Will Be Time Enough To Do So When I Shall Have Deserved It.” He Admitted The Common People To See Him Perform His Exercises In The Campus Martius. He Frequently Declaimed In Public, And Recited Verses Of His Own Composing, Not Only At Home, But In The Theatre; So Much To The Joy Of All The People, That Public Prayers Were Appointed To Be Put Up To The Gods Upon That Account; And The Verses Which Had Been Publicly Read, Were, After Being Written In Gold Letters, Consecrated To Jupiter Capitolinus.</h4></div> </div>
