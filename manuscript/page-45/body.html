Meanwhile, The Republic Being In Consternation At The Murder Of Publius Clodius, And The Senate Passing A Vote That Only One Consul, Namely, Cneius Pompeius, Should Be Chosen For The Ensuing Year, He Prevailed With The Tribunes Of The People, Who Intended Joining Him In Nomination With Pompey, To Propose To The People A Bill, Enabling Him, Though Absent, To Become A Candidate For His Second Consulship, When The Term Of His Command Should Be Near Expiring, That He Might Not Be Obliged On That Account To Quit His Province Too Soon, And Before The Conclusion Of The War. Having Attained This Object, Carrying His Views Still Higher, And Animated With The Hopes Of Success, He Omitted No  Opportunity Of Gaining Universal Favour, By Acts Of Liberality And Kindness To Individuals, Both In Public And Private. With Money Raised From The Spoils Of The War, He Began To Construct A New Forum, The Ground-plot Of Which Cost Him Above A Hundred Millions Of Sesterces . He Promised The People A Public Entertainment Of Gladiators, And A Feast In Memory Of His Daughter, Such As No One Before Him Had Ever Given. The More To Raise Their Expectations On This Occasion, Although He Had Agreed With Victuallers Of All Denominations For His Feast, He Made Yet Farther Preparations In Private Houses. He Issued An Order, That The Most Celebrated Gladiators, If At Any Time During The Combat They Incurred The Displeasure Of The Public, Should Be Immediately Carried Off By Force, And Reserved For Some Future Occasion. Young Gladiators He Trained Up, Not In The School, And By The Masters, Of Defence, But In The Houses Of Roman Knights, And Even Senators, Skilled In The Use Of Arms, Earnestly Requesting Them, As Appears From His Letters, To Undertake The Discipline Of Those Novitiates, And To Give Them The Word During Their Exercises. He Doubled The Pay Of The Legions In Perpetuity; Allowing Them Likewise Corn, When It Was In Plenty, Without Any Restriction; And Sometimes Distributing To Every Soldier In His Army A Slave, And A Portion Of Land.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
