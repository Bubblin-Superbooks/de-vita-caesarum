Having Exhausted The Exchequer By The Expense Of His Buildings And Public Spectacles, With The Augmentation Of Pay Lately Granted To The Troops, He Made An Attempt At The Reduction Of The Army, In Order To Lessen The Military Charges. But Reflecting, That He Should, By This Measure, Expose Himself To The Insults Of The Barbarians, While It Would Not Suffice To Extricate Him From His Embarrassments, He Had Recourse To Plundering His Subjects By Every Mode Of Exaction. The Estates Of The Living And The Dead Were Sequestered Upon Any Accusation, By Whomsoever Preferred. The Unsupported Allegation Of Any One Person, Relative To A Word Or Action Construed To Affect The Dignity Of The Emperor, Was Sufficient. Inheritances, To Which He Had Not The Slightest Pretension, Were Confiscated, If There Was Found So Much As One Person To Say, He Had Heard From The Deceased When Living, “That He Had Made The Emperor His Heir.” Besides The Exactions From Others, The Poll-tax On The Jews Was Levied With Extreme Rigour, Both On Those Who Lived After The Manner Of Jews In The City, Without Publicly Professing Themselves To Be Such , And On Those Who, By  Concealing Their Origin, Avoided Paying The Tribute Imposed Upon That People. I Remember, When I Was A Youth, To Have Been Present , When An Old Man, Ninety Years Of Age, Had His Person Exposed To View In A Very Crowded Court, In Order That, On Inspection, The Procurator Might Satisfy Himself Whether He Was Circumcised.</h4></div> </div>
