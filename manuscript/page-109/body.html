When He Had Taken His Seat, The Conspirators Stood Round Him, Under Colour Of Paying Their Compliments; And Immediately Tullius Cimber, Who Had Engaged To Commence The Assault, Advancing Nearer Than The Rest, As If He Had Some Favour To Request, Caesar Made Signs That He Should Defer His Petition To Some Other Time. Tullius Immediately Seized Him By The Toga, On Both Shoulders; At Which Caesar Crying Out, “Violence Is Meant!” One Of The Cassii Wounded Him A Little Below The Throat. Caesar Seized Him By The Arm, And Ran It Through With His Style ; And Endeavouring To Rush Forward Was Stopped By Another Wound. Finding Himself Now Attacked On All Hands With Naked Poniards, He Wrapped The Toga  About His Head, And At The Same Moment Drew The Skirt Round His Legs With His Left Hand, That He Might Fall More Decently With The Lower Part Of His Body Covered. He Was Stabbed With Three And Twenty Wounds, Uttering A Groan Only, But No Cry, At The First Wound; Although Some Authors Relate, That When Marcus Brutus Fell Upon Him, He Exclaimed, “What! Art Thou, Too, One Of Them? Thou, My Son!”  The Whole Assembly Instantly  Dispersing, He Lay For Some Time After He Expired, Until Three Of His Slaves Laid The Body On A Litter, And Carried It Home, With One Arm Hanging Down Over The Side. Among So Many Wounds, There Was None That Was Mortal, In The Opinion Of The Surgeon Antistius, Except The Second, Which He Received In The Breast. The Conspirators Meant To Drag His Body Into The Tiber As Soon As They Had Killed Him; To Confiscate His Estate, And Rescind All His Enactments; But They Were Deterred By Fear Of Mark Antony, And Lepidus, Caesar’s Master Of The Horse, And Abandoned Their Intentions.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
