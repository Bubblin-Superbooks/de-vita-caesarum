His Body Was Carried Privately Into The Lamian Gardens , Where It Was Half Burnt Upon A Pile Hastily Raised, And Then Had Some Earth Carelessly Thrown Over It. It Was Afterwards Disinterred By His Sisters, On Their Return From Banishment, Burnt To Ashes, And Buried. Before This Was Done, It Is Well Known That The Keepers Of The Gardens Were Greatly Disturbed By Apparitions; And That Not A Night Passed Without Some Terrible Alarm Or Other In The House Where He Was Slain, Until It Was Destroyed By Fire. His Wife Caesonia Was Killed With Him, Being Stabbed By A Centurion; And His Daughter Had Her Brains Knocked Out Against A Wall.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
