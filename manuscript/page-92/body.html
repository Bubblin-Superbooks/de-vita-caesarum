Upon His Entering On The Civil War, The Centurions Of Every Legion Offered, Each Of Them, To Maintain A Horseman At His Own Expense, And The Whole Army Agreed To Serve Gratis, Without Either Corn Or Pay; Those Amongst Them Who Were Rich, Charging Themselves With The Maintenance Of The Poor. No One Of Them, During The Whole Course Of The War, Deserted To The Enemy; And Many Of Those Who Were Made Prisoners, Though They Were Offered Their Lives, Upon Condition Of Bearing Arms Against Him, Refused To Accept The Terms. They Endured Want, And Other Hardships, Not Only  When They Were Besieged Themselves, But When They Besieged Others, To Such A Degree, That Pompey, When Blocked Up In The Neighbourhood Of Dyrrachium, Upon Seeing A Sort Of Bread Made Of An Herb, Which They Lived Upon, Said, “I Have To Do With Wild Beasts,” And Ordered It Immediately To Be Taken Away; Because, If His Troops Should See It, Their Spirit Might Be Broken By Perceiving The Endurance And Determined Resolution Of The Enemy. With What Bravery They Fought, One Instance Affords Sufficient Proof; Which Is, That After An Unsuccessful Engagement At Dyrrachium, They Called For Punishment; Insomuch That Their General Found It More Necessary To Comfort Than To Punish Them. In Other Battles, In Different Quarters, They Defeated With Ease Immense Armies Of The Enemy, Although They Were Much Inferior To Them In Number. In Short, One Cohort Of The Sixth Legion Held Out A Fort Against Four Legions Belonging To Pompey, During Several Hours; Being Almost Every One Of Them Wounded By The Vast Number Of Arrows Discharged Against Them, And Of Which There Were Found Within The Ramparts A Hundred And Thirty Thousand. This Is No Way Surprising, When We Consider The Conduct Of Some Individuals Amongst Them; Such As That Of Cassius Scaeva, A Centurion, Or Caius Acilius, A Common Soldier, Not To Speak Of Others. Scaeva, After Having An Eye Struck Out, Being Run Through The Thigh And The Shoulder, And Having His Shield Pierced In An Hundred And Twenty Places, Maintained Obstinately The Guard Of The Gate Of A Fort, With The Command Of Which He Was Intrusted. Acilius, In The Sea-fight At Marseilles, Having Seized A Ship Of The Enemy’s With His Right Hand, And That Being Cut Off, In Imitation Of That Memorable Instance Of Resolution In Cynaegirus Amongst The Greeks, Boarded The Enemy’s Ship, Bearing Down All Before Him With The Boss Of His Shield.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
