Still shaking, as he strode, his vast long spear.</p><p>And of Cerylus, a freedman, who being very rich, had begun to pass himself off as free-born, to elude the exchequer at his decease, and assumed the name of Laches, he said:</p><p>——O Lachaes, Lachaes,
Epan apothanaes, authis ex archaes esae Kaerylos.</p><p>Ah, Laches, Laches! when thou art no more,
