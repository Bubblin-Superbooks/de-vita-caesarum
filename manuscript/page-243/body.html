She, Indeed, Conceived Once, But Miscarried. He Gave His Daughter Julia In The First Instance To Marcellus, His Sister’s Son, Who Had Just Completed His Minority; And, After His Death, To Marcus Agrippa, Having Prevailed With His Sister To Yield Her Son-in-law To His Wishes; For At That Time Agrippa Was Married To One Of The Marcellas, And Had Children By Her. Agrippa Dying Also, He For A Long Time Thought Of Several Matches For Julia In Even The Equestrian Order, And At Last Resolved Upon Selecting Tiberius For His Step-son; And He Obliged Him To Part With His Wife At That Time Pregnant, And Who Had Already Brought Him A Child.
