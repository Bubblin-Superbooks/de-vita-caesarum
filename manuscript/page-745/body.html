In Stature He Was A Little Below The Common Height; His Skin Was Foul And Spotted; His Hair Inclined To Yellow; His Features Were Agreeable, Rather Than Handsome; His Eyes Grey And Dull, His Neck Was Thick, His Belly Prominent, His Legs Very Slender, His Constitution Sound. For, Though Excessively Luxurious In His Mode Of Living, He Had, In The Course Of Fourteen Years, Only Three Fits Of Sickness; Which Were So Slight, That He Neither Forbore The Use Of Wine, Nor Made Any Alteration In His Usual Diet. In His Dress, And The Care Of His Person, He Was So Careless, That He Had His Hair Cut In Rings, One Above Another; And When In Achaia, He Let It Grow Long Behind; And He Generally Appeared In Public In The Loose Dress Which He Used At Table, With A Handkerchief About His Neck, And Without Either A Girdle Or Shoes.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
