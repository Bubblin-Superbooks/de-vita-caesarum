He Lived In The Habit Of Incest With All His Sisters; And At Table, When Much Company Was Present, He Placed Each Of Them In Turns Below Him, Whilst His Wife Reclined Above Him. It Is Believed, That He Deflowered One Of Them, Drusilla, Before He Had Assumed The Robe Of Manhood; And Was Even Caught In Her Embraces By His Grandmother Antonia, With Whom They Were Educated Together. When She Was Afterwards Married To Cassius Longinus, A Man Of Consular Rank, He Took Her From Him, And Kept Her Constantly As If She Were His Lawful Wife. In A Fit Of Sickness, He By His Will Appointed Her Heiress Both Of His Estate And The Empire. After Her Death, He Ordered A Public Mourning For Her; During Which It Was Capital For Any Person To Laugh, Use The Bath, Or Sup With His Parents, Wife, Or Children. Being Inconsolable Under His Affliction, He Went Hastily, And In The Night-time, From The City; Going Through Campania To Syracuse, And Then Suddenly Returned Without Shaving His Beard, Or Trimming His Hair. Nor Did He Ever Afterwards, In Matters Of The Greatest Importance, Not Even In The Assemblies Of The People Or Before The Soldiers, Swear Any Otherwise, Than “By The Divinity Of Drusilla.” The Rest Of His Sisters He Did Not Treat With So Much Fondness Or Regard; But Frequently Prostituted Them To His Catamites. He Therefore The More Readily Condemned Them In The Case Of Aemilius Lepidus, As Guilty Of Adultery, And Privy To That Conspiracy Against Him. Nor Did He Only Divulge Their Own Hand-writing Relative To The Affair, Which He Procured By Base And Lewd Means, But Likewise Consecrated To Mars The Avenger Three Swords Which Had Been Prepared To Stab Him, With An Inscription, Setting Forth The Occasion Of Their Consecration.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
