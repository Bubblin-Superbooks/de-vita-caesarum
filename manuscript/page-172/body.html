After The Subjugation Of Spain, While Caesar Was Meditating An Expedition Against The Dacians And Parthians, He Was Sent Before Him To Apollonia, Where He Applied Himself To His Studies; Until Receiving Intelligence That His Uncle Was Murdered, And That He Was Appointed His Heir, He Hesitated For Some Time Whether He Should Call To His Aid The Legions Stationed In The Neighbourhood; But He Abandoned The Design As Rash And Premature.
