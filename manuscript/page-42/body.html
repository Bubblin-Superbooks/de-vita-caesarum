When The Term Of His Consulship Had Expired, Upon A Motion Being Made In The Senate By Caius Memmius And Lucius Domitius, The Praetors, Respecting The Transactions Of The Year Past, He Offered To Refer Himself To The House; But  They Declining The Business, After Three Days Spent In Vain Altercation, He Set Out For His Province. Immediately, However, His Quaestor Was Charged With Several Misdemeanors, For The Purpose Of Implicating Caesar Himself. Indeed, An Accusation Was Soon After Preferred Against Him By Lucius Antistius, Tribune Of The People; But By Making An Appeal To The Tribuneâ€™s Colleagues, He Succeeded In Having The Prosecution Suspended During His Absence In The Service Of The State. To Secure Himself, Therefore, For The Time To Come, He Was Particularly Careful To Secure The Good-will Of The Magistrates At The Annual Elections, Assisting None Of The Candidates With His Interest, Nor Suffering Any Persons To Be Advanced To Any Office, Who Would Not Positively Undertake To Defend Him In His Absence For Which Purpose He Made No Scruple To Require Of Some Of Them An Oath, And Even A Written Obligation.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
