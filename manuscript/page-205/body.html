Some Laws He Abrogated, And He Made Some New Ones; Such As The Sumptuary Law, That Relating To Adultery And The Violation Of Chastity, The Law Against Bribery In Elections, And Likewise That For The Encouragement Of Marriage. Having Been More Severe In His Reform Of This Law Than The Rest, He Found The People Utterly Averse To Submit To It, Unless The Penalties Were Abolished Or Mitigated, Besides Allowing An Interval Of Three Years After A Wife’s Death, And Increasing The Premiums On Marriage. The Equestrian Order Clamoured Loudly, At A Spectacle In The Theatre, For Its Total Repeal; Whereupon He Sent For The Children Of Germanicus, And Shewed Them Partly Sitting Upon His Own Lap, And Partly On Their Father’s; Intimating By His Looks And Gestures, That They Ought Not To Think It A Grievance To Follow The Example Of That Young Man. But Finding That The Force Of The Law Was Eluded, By Marrying Girls Under The Age Of Puberty, And By Frequent Change Of Wives, He Limited The Time For Consummation After Espousals, And Imposed Restrictions On Divorce.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
