<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>By order of Augustus, an inquiry was made after the author; and Virgil not declaring himself, the verses were claimed by Bathyllus, a contemptible poet, but who was liberally rewarded on the occasion. Virgil, provoked at the falsehood of the impostor, again wrote the verses on some conspicuous part of the palace, and under them the following line:</p><p>Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honorem;
I wrote the verse, another filched the praise;</p><p>with the beginning of another line in these words:</p><p>Sic vos, non vobis,
Not for yourselves, you——</p><p>repeated four times. Augustus expressing a desire that the lines should be finished, and Bathyllus proving unequal to the task, Virgil at last filled up the blanks in this manner:</p><p>Sic vos, non vobis, nidificatis, aves;
Sic vos, non vobis, vellera fertis, oves;
Sic vos, non vobis, mellificatis, apes;
Sic vos, non vobis, fertis aratra, boves.</p></div> </div>
