But The Father Of Tiberius Caesar, Being Quaestor To Caius Caesar, And Commander Of His Fleet In The War Of Alexandria, Contributed Greatly To Its Success. He Was Therefore Made One Of The High-priests In The Room Of Publius Scipio ; And Was Sent To Settle Some Colonies In Gaul, And Amongst The Rest, Those Of Narbonne And Arles . After The Assassination Of Caesar, However, When The Rest Of The Senators, For Fear Of Public Disturbances; Were For Having The Affair Buried In Oblivion, He Proposed A Resolution For Rewarding Those Who Had Killed The Tyrant. Having Filled The Office Of Praetor , And At The End Of The Year A Disturbance Breaking Out Amongst The Triumviri, He Kept The Badges Of His Office Beyond The Legal Time; And Following Lucius Antonius The Consul, Brother Of The Triumvir, To Perusia , Though The Rest Submitted, Yet He Himself Continued Firm To The Party, And Escaped First To Praeneste, And Then To Naples; Whence, Having In Vain Invited The Slaves To Liberty, He Fled Over To Sicily. But Resenting  His Not Being Immediately Admitted Into The Presence Of Sextus Pompey, And Being Also Prohibited The Use Of The Fasces, He Went Over Into Achaia To Mark Antony; With Whom, Upon A Reconciliation Soon After Brought About Amongst The Several Contending Parties, He Returned To Rome; And, At The Request Of Augustus, Gave Up To Him His Wife Livia Drusilla, Although She Was Then Big With Child, And Had Before Borne Him A Son. He Died Not Long After; Leaving Behind Him Two Sons, Tiberius And Drusus Nero.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
