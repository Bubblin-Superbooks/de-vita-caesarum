Going In Quest Of Cornelius Cinna, Who Had In A Speech, The Day Before, Reflected Severely Upon Caesar, And Mistaking For Him Helvius Cinna, Who Happened To Fall Into Their Hands, They Murdered The Latter, And Carried His Head About The City On The Point Of A Spear. They Afterwards Erected In The Forum A Column Of Numidian Marble, Formed Of One Stone Nearly Twenty Feet High, And Inscribed Upon It These Words, To The Father Of His Country. At This Column They Continued For A Long Time To Offer Sacrifices, Make Vows, And Decide Controversies, In Which They Swore By Caesar.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
