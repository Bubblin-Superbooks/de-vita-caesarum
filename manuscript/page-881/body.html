<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Viii. Returning Now To Rome, Under These Auspices, And With A Great Reputation, After Enjoying A Triumph For Victories Over The Jews, He Added Eight Consulships  To His Former One. He Likewise Assumed The Censorship, And Made It His Principal Concern, During The Whole Of His Government, First To Restore Order In The State, Which Had Been Almost Ruined, And Was In A Tottering Condition, And Then To Improve It. The Soldiers, One Part Of Them Emboldened By Victory, And The Other Smarting With The Disgrace Of Their Defeat, Had Abandoned Themselves To Every Species Of Licentiousness And Insolence. Nay, The Provinces, Too, And Free Cities, And Some Kingdoms In Alliance With Rome, Were All In A Disturbed State. He, Therefore, Disbanded Many Of Vitellius’s Soldiers, And Punished Others; And So Far Was He From Granting Any Extraordinary Favours To The Sharers Of His Success, That It Was Late Before He Paid The Gratuities Due To Them By Law. That He Might Let Slip No Opportunity Of Reforming The Discipline Of The Army, Upon A Young Man’s Coming Much Perfumed To Return Him Thanks  For Having Appointed Him To Command A Squadron Of Horse, He Turned Away His Head In Disgust, And, Giving Him This Sharp Reprimand, “I Had Rather You Had Smelt Of Garlic,” Revoked His Commission. When The Men Belonging To The Fleet, Who Travelled By Turns From Ostia And Puteoli To Rome, Petitioned For An Addition To Their Pay, Under The Name Of Shoe-money, Thinking That It Would Answer Little Purpose To Send Them Away Without A Reply, He Ordered Them For The Future To Run Barefooted; And So They Have Done Ever Since. He Deprived Of Their Liberties, Achaia, Lycia, Rhodes, Byzantium, And Samos; And Reduced Them Into The Form Of Provinces; Thrace, Also, And Cilicia, As Well As Comagene, Which Until That Time Had Been Under The Government Of Kings. He Stationed Some Legions In Cappadocia On Account Of The Frequent Inroads Of The Barbarians, And, Instead Of A Roman Knight, Appointed As Governor Of It A Man Of Consular Rank. The Ruins Of Houses Which Had Been Burnt Down Long Before, Being A Great Desight To The City, He Gave Leave To Any One Who Would, To Take Possession Of The Void Ground And Build Upon It, If The Proprietors Should Hesitate To Perform The Work Themselves. He Resolved Upon Rebuilding The Capitol, And Was The Foremost To Put His Hand To Clearing The Ground Of The Rubbish, And Removed Some Of It Upon His Own Shoulder. And He Undertook, Likewise, To Restore The Three Thousand Tables Of Brass Which Had Been Destroyed In The Fire Which Consumed The Capitol; Searching In All Quarters For Copies Of Those Curious And Ancient Records, In Which Were Contained The Decrees Of The Senate, Almost From The Building Of The City, As Well As The Acts Of The People, Relative To Alliances, Treaties, And Privileges Granted To Any Person.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
