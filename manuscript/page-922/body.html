At The Close Of The Public Spectacles, He Wept Bitterly In The Presence Of The People, And Then Retired Into The Sabine Country , Rather Melancholy, Because A Victim Had Made Its Escape While He Was Sacrificing, And Loud Thunder Had Been Heard While The Atmosphere Was Serene. At The First Resting-place On The Road, He Was Seized With A Fever, And Being Carried Forward In A Litter, They Say That He Drew Back The Curtains, And Looked Up To Heaven, Complaining Heavily, “That His Life Was Taken From Him, Though He Had Done Nothing To Deserve It; For There Was No Action Of His That He Had Occasion To Repent Of, But One.” What That Was, He Neither Disclosed Himself, Nor Is It Easy For Us To Conjecture. Some Imagine That He Alluded To The Connection Which He Had Formerly Had With His Brother’s Wife. But Domitia Solemnly Denied It On Oath; Which She Would Never Have Done, Had There Been Any Truth In The Report; Nay, She Would Certainly Have Gloried In It, As She Was Forward Enough To Boast Of All Her Scandalous Intrigues.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
