<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">trumpet-stirred, he sprung to manly arms,
And sage Ulysses led him to the Trojan coast.</p><p>The Silvae is a collection of poems almost entirely in heroic verse, divided into five books, and for the most part written extempore. Statius himself affirms, in his Dedication to Stella, that the production of none of them employed him more than two days; yet many of them consist of between one hundred and two hundred hexameter lines. We meet with one of two hundred and sixteen lines; one, of two hundred and thirty-four; one, of two hundred and sixty-two; and one of two hundred and seventy-seven; a rapidity of composition approaching to what Horace mentions of the poet Lucilius. It is no small encomium to observe, that, considered as extemporaneous productions,  the meanest in the collection is far from meriting censure, either in point of sentiment or expression; and many of them contain passages which command our applause.</p></div> </div>
