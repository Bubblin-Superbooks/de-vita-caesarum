He Issued Likewise This Proclamation: “I Am Coming, But For Those Only Who Wish For Me, The Equestrian Order And The People; For I Shall No Longer Treat The Senate As Their Fellow-citizen Or Prince.” He Forbad Any Of The Senators To Come To Meet Him; And Either Abandoning Or Deferring His Triumph, He Entered The City In Ovation On His Birthday.

This Is Placed Beyond All Question, By Two Books Which Were Found In His Cabinet  Under Different Titles; One Being Called The Sword, And The Other, The Dagger. They Both Contained Private Marks, And The Names Of Those Who Were Devoted To Death.
