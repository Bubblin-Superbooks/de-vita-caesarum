During Nine Years In Which He Held The Government Of The Province, His Achievements Were As Follows: He Reduced All Gaul, Bounded By The Pyrenean Forest, The Alps, Mount Gebenna, And The Two Rivers, The Rhine And The Rhone, And Being About Three Thousand Two Hundred Miles In Compass, Into The Form Of A Province, Excepting Only The Nations In Alliance With The Republic, And Such As Had Merited His Favour; Imposing Upon This New Acquisition An Annual Tribute Of Forty Millions Of Sesterces. He Was The First Of The Romans Who, Crossing The Rhine By A Bridge, Attacked The Germanic Tribes Inhabiting The Country Beyond That River, Whom He Defeated In Several Engagements. He Also Invaded The Britons, A People Formerly Unknown, And Having Vanquished Them, Exacted From Them Contributions And Hostages. Amidst Such A Series Of Successes, He Experienced Thrice Only Any Signal Disaster; Once In Britain, When His Fleet Was Nearly Wrecked In A Storm; In Gaul, At Gergovia, Where One Of His Legions Was Put To The Rout; And In The Territory Of The Germans, His Lieutenants Titurius And Aurunculeius Were Cut Off By An Ambuscade.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
