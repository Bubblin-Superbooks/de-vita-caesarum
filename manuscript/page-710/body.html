Petulancy, Lewdness, Luxury, Avarice, And Cruelty, He Practised At First With Reserve And In Private, As If Prompted To Them Only By The Folly Of Youth; But, Even Then, The World Was Of Opinion That They Were The Faults Of His Nature, And Not Of His Age. After It Was Dark, He Used To Enter The Taverns Disguised In A Cap Or A Wig, And Ramble About The Streets In Sport, Which Was Not Void Of Mischief. He Used To Beat Those He Met Coming Home From Supper; And, If They Made Any Resistance, Would Wound Them, And Throw Them Into The Common Sewer.

In The Scuffles Which Took Place On Those Occasions, He Often Ran The Hazard Of Losing His Eyes, And Even His Life; Being Beaten Almost To Death By A Senator, For Handling His Wife Indecently. After This Adventure, He Never Again Ventured Abroad At That Time Of Night, Without Some Tribunes Following Him At A Little Distance.
