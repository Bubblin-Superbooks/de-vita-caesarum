His Mother Being Used To Make Strict Inquiry Into What He Said Or Did, And To Reprimand Him With The Freedom Of A Parent, He Was So Much Offended, That He Endeavoured To Expose Her To Public Resentment, By Frequently Pretending A Resolution To Quit The Government, And Retire To Rhodes. Soon Afterwards, He Deprived Her Of All Honour And Power, Took From Her The Guard Of Roman And German Soldiers, Banished Her From The Palace And From His Society, And Persecuted Her In Every Way He Could Contrive; Employing Persons To Harass Her When At Rome With Law-suits, And To Disturb Her In Her Retirement From Town With The Most Scurrilous And Abusive Language, Following Her About By Land And Sea. But Being Terrified With Her Menaces And Violent Spirit, He Resolved Upon Her Destruction, And Thrice Attempted It By Poison. Finding, However,  And Burning Torches Of The Furies. Nay, He Attempted By Magical Rites To Bring Up Her Ghost From Below, And Soften Her Rage Against Him. When He Was In Greece, He Durst Not Attend The Celebration Of The Eleusinian Mysteries, At The Initiation Of Which, Impious And Wicked Persons Are Warned By The Voice Of The Herald From Approaching The Rites . Besides The Murder Of His Mother, He Had Been Guilty Of That Of His Aunt; For, Being Obliged To Keep Her Bed In Consequence Of A Complaint In Her Bowels, He Paid Her A Visit, And She, Being Then Advanced In Years, Stroking His Downy Chin, In The Tenderness Of Affection, Said To Him: “May I But Live To See The Day When This Is Shaved For The First Time , And I Shall Then Die Contented.” He Turned, However, To Those About Him, Made A Jest Of It, Saying, That He Would Have His Beard Immediately Taken Off, And Ordered The Physicians To Give Her More Violent Purgatives. He Seized Upon Her Estate Before She Had Expired; Suppressing Her Will, That He Might Enjoy The Whole Himself.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
