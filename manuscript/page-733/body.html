In Preparing For This Expedition, His First Care Was To Provide Carriages For His Musical Instruments And Machinery To Be Used Upon The Stage; To Have The Hair Of The Concubines He Carried With Him Dressed In The Fashion Of Men; And To Supply Them With Battle-axes, And Amazonian Bucklers. He Summoned The City-tribes To Enlist; But No Qualified Persons Appearing, He Ordered All Masters To Send A Certain Number Of Slaves, The Best They Had, Not Excepting Their Stewards And Secretaries.
