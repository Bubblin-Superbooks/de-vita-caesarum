Nero Was Succeeded By Galba , Who Was Not In The Remotest Degree Allied To The Family Of The Caesars, But, Without Doubt, Of Very Noble Extraction, Being Descended From A Great And Ancient Family; For He Always Used To Put Amongst His Other Titles, Upon The Bases Of His Statues, His Being Great-grandson To Q. Catulus Capitolinus.
