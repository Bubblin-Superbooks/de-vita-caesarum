Offended At The Vices Of The Former, Who Was Of A Loose Disposition And Led A Dissolute Life, He Was Not Much Affected At His Death; But, Almost Immediately After The Funeral, Resumed His Attention To Business, And Prevented The Courts From Being Longer Closed. The Ambassadors From The People Of Ilium Coming Rather Late To Offer Their Condolence, He Said To Them By Way Of Banter, As If The Affair Had Already Faded From His Memory, “And I Heartily Condole With You On The Loss Of Your Renowned Countryman, Hector.” He So Much Affected To Depreciate Germanicus, That He Spoke Of His Achievements As Utterly Insignificant, And Railed At His Most Glorious Victories As Ruinous To The State; Complaining Of Him Also To The Senate For Going To Alexandria Without His Knowledge, Upon Occasion Of A Great And Sudden Famine At Rome. It Was Believed That He Took Care To Have Him Dispatched By Cneius Piso, His Lieutenant In Syria. This Person Was Afterwards Tried For The Murder, And Would, As Was Supposed, Have Produced His Orders, Had They Not Been Contained In A Private And Confidential Dispatch. The Following Words Therefore Were Posted Up In Many Places, And Frequently Shouted In The Night: “Give Us Back Our Germanicus.” This Suspicion Was Afterwards Confirmed By The Barbarous Treatment Of His Wife And Children.</h4></div> </div>
