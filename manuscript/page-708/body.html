In These Contests, He Adhered So Strictly To The Rules,  That He Never Durst Spit, Nor Wipe The Sweat From His Forehead In Any Other Way Than With His Sleeve. Having, In The Performance Of A Tragedy, Dropped His Sceptre, And Not Quickly Recovering It, He Was In A Great Fright, Lest He Should Be Set Aside For The Miscarriage, And Could Not Regain His Assurance, Until An Actor Who Stood By Swore He Was Certain It Had Not Been Observed In The Midst Of The Acclamations And Exultations Of The People. When The Prize Was Adjudged To Him, He Always Proclaimed It Himself; And Even Entered The Lists With The Heralds. That No Memory Or The Least Monument Might Remain Of Any Other Victor In The Sacred Grecian Games, He Ordered All Their Statues And Pictures To Be Pulled Down, Dragged Away With Hooks, And Thrown Into The Common Sewers. He Drove The Chariot With Various Numbers Of Horses, And At The Olympic Games With No Fewer Than Ten; Though, In A Poem Of His, He Had Reflected Upon Mithridates For That Innovation. Being Thrown Out Of His Chariot, He Was Again Replaced, But Could Not Retain His Seat, And Was Obliged To Give Up, Before He Reached The Goal, But Was Crowned Notwithstanding. On His Departure, He Declared The Whole Province A Free Country, And Conferred Upon The Judges In The Several Games The Freedom Of Rome, With Large Sums Of Money. All These Favours He Proclaimed Himself With His Own Voice, From The Middle Of The Stadium, During The Solemnity Of The Isthmian Games.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
