When The Soldiers Of The Tenth Legion At Rome Demanded Their Discharge And Rewards For Their Service, With Violent Threats And No Small Danger To The City, Although The War Was Then Raging In Africa, He Did Not Hesitate, Contrary To The Advice Of His Friends, To Meet The Legion, And Disband It. But Addressing Them By The Title Of “Quirites,” Instead Of “Soldiers,” He By This Single Word So Thoroughly Brought Them Round And Changed Their Determination, That They Immediately Cried Out, They Were His “Soldiers,” And Followed Him To Africa, Although He Had Refused Their Service. He Nevertheless Punished The Most Mutinous Among Them, With The Loss Of A Third Of Their Share In The Plunder, And The Land Destined For Them.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
