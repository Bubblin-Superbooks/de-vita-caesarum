He Celebrated The Marriage Of His Daughter And The Birth-day Of A Grandson With Great Privacy, At Home. He Recalled None Of Those Who Had Been Banished, Without A Decree Of The Senate: And Requested Of Them Permission For The Prefect Of The Military Tribunes And Pretorian Guards To Attend Him In The Senate-house ; And  Also That They Would Be Pleased To Bestow Upon His Procurators Judicial Authority In The Provinces . He Asked Of The Consuls Likewise The Privilege Of Holding Fairs Upon His Private Estate. He Frequently Assisted The Magistrates In The Trial Of Causes, As One Of Their Assessors. And When They Gave Public Spectacles, He Would Rise Up With The Rest Of The Spectators, And Salute Them Both By Words And Gestures. When The Tribunes Of The People Came To Him While He Was On The Tribunal, He Excused Himself, Because, On Account Of The Crowd, He Could Not Hear Them Unless They Stood. In A Short Time, By This Conduct, He Wrought Himself So Much Into The Favour And Affection Of The Public, That When, Upon His Going To Ostia, A Report Was Spread In The City That He Had Been Way-laid And Slain, The People Never Ceased Cursing The Soldiers For Traitors, And The Senate As Parricides, Until One Or Two Persons, And Presently After Several Others, Were Brought By The Magistrates Upon The Rostra, Who Assured Them That He Was Alive, And Not Far From The City, On His Way Home.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
