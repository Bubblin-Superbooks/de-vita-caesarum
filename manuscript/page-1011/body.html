Curtius Nicia Was The Intimate Friend Of Cneius Pompeius And Caius Memmius; But Having Carried Notes From Memmius To Pompey’s Wife , When She Was Debauched By Memmius, Pompey Was Indignant, And Forbad Him His House. He Was Also On Familiar Terms With Marcus Cicero, Who Thus Speaks Of Him In His Epistle To Dolabella : “I Have More Need Of Receiving Letters From You, Than You Have Of Desiring Them From Me. For There Is Nothing Going On At Rome In Which I Think You Would Take Any Interest, Except, Perhaps, That You May Like To Know That I Am Appointed Umpire Between Our Friends Nicias And Vidius. The One, It Appears, Alleges In Two Short Verses That Nicias Owes Him  Money; The Other, Like An Aristarchus, Cavils At Them. I, Like An Old Critic, Am To Decide Whether They Are Nicias’s Or Spurious.”</h4></div> </div>
