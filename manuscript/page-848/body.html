He Died Of Palsy, The Day After His Seizure With It, Leaving Behind Him Two Sons, Whom He Had By A Most Excellent And Respectable Wife, Sextilia. He Had Lived To See Them Both Consuls, The Same Year And During The Whole Year Also; The Younger Succeeding The Elder For The Last Six Months . The Senate Honoured Him After His Decease With A Funeral At The Public Expense, And With A Statue In The Rostra, Which Had This Inscription Upon The Base: “One Who Was Steadfast In His Loyalty To His Prince.” The Emperor Aulus Vitellius, The Son Of This Lucius, Was Born Upon The Eighth Of The Calends Of October [24Th September], Or, As Some Say, Upon The Seventh Of The Ides Of September [7Th September], In The Consulship Of Drusus Caesar And Norbanus Flaccus . His Parents Were So  Terrified With The Predictions Of Astrologers Upon The Calculation Of His Nativity, That His Father Used His Utmost Endeavours To Prevent His Being Sent Governor Into Any Of The Provinces, Whilst He Was Alive. His Mother, Upon His Being Sent To The Legions , And Also Upon His Being Proclaimed Emperor, Immediately Lamented Him As Utterly Ruined. He Spent His Youth Amongst The Catamites Of Tiberius At Capri, Was Himself Constantly Stigmatized With The Name Of Spintria , And Was Supposed To Have Been The Occasion Of His Father’s Advancement, By Consenting To Gratify The Emperor’s Unnatural Lust.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
