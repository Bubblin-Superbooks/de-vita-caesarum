It Is Supposed That He Was Assisted In Procuring This Appointment By The Interest Of Titus Junius, A Man Of Great Influence At That Time; Whose Friendship He Had Long Before Gained By Favouring The Same Set Of Charioteers With Him In The Circensian Games. But Galba Openly Declared That None Were Less To Be Feared Than Those Who Only Cared For Their Bellies, And That Even His Enormous Appetite Must Be Satisfied With The Plenty Of That Province; So That It Is Evident He Was Selected For That Government More Out Of Contempt Than Kindness.
