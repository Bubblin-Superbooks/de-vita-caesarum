Before He Left The Province, He Formed A Design Of The Most Horrid Crueltyâ€”to Massacre The Legions Which Had Mutinied Upon The Death Of Augustus, For Seizing And Detaining By Force His Father, Germanicus, Their Commander, And Himself, Then An Infant, In The Camp. Though He Was With Great Difficulty Dissuaded From This Rash Attempt, Yet Neither The Most Urgent Entreaties Nor Representations Could Prevent Him From Persisting In The Design Of Decimating These Legions. Accordingly, He Ordered Them To Assemble Unarmed, Without So Much As Their Swords; And Then Surrounded Them With Armed Horse. But Finding That Many Of Them, Suspecting That Violence Was Intended, Were Making Off, To Arm In Their Own Defence, He Quitted The Assembly As Fast As He Could, And Immediately Marched For Rome; Bending Now All His Fury Against The Senate, Whom He Publicly Threatened, To Divert The General Attention From The Clamour Excited By His Disgraceful Conduct. Amongst Other Pretexts Of Offence, He Complained That He Was Defrauded Of A Triumph, Which Was Justly His Due, Though He Had Just Before Forbidden, Upon Pain Of Death, Any Honour To Be Decreed Him.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
