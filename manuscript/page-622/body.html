The Equestrian  Order Twice Made Choice Of Him To Intercede On Their Behalf; Once To Obtain From The Consuls The Favour Of Bearing On Their Shoulders The Corpse Of Augustus To Rome, And A Second Time To Congratulate Him Upon The Death Of Sejanus. When He Entered The Theatre, They Used To Rise, And Put Off Their Cloaks. The Senate Likewise Decreed, That He Should Be Added To The Number Of The Augustal College Of Priests, Who Were Chosen By Lot; And Soon Afterwards, When His House Was Burnt Down, That It Should Be Rebuilt At The Public Charge; And That He Should Have The Privilege Of Giving His Vote Amongst The Men Of Consular Rank. This Decree Was, However, Repealed; Tiberius Insisting To Have Him Excused On Account Of His Imbecility, And Promising To Make Good His Loss At His Own Expense. But At His Death, He Named Him In His Will, Amongst His Third Heirs, For A Third Part Of His Estate; Leaving Him Besides A Legacy Of Two Millions Of Sesterces, And Expressly Recommending Him To The Armies, The Senate And People Of Rome, Amongst His Other Relations.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
