<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xxv. The Cause Of His Long Demur Was Fear Of The Dangers Which Threatened Him On All Hands; Insomuch That He Said, “I Have Got A Wolf By The Ears.” For A Slave Of Agrippa’s, Clemens By Name, Had Drawn Together A Considerable Force To Revenge His Master’s Death; Lucius Scribonius Libo, A Senator Of The First Distinction, Was Secretly Fomenting A Rebellion; And The Troops Both In Illyricum And Germany Were Mutinous. Both Armies Insisted Upon High Demands, Particularly That Their Pay Should Be Made Equal To That Of The Pretorian Guards. The Army In Germany Absolutely Refused To Acknowledge A Prince Who Was Not Their Own Choice; And Urged, With All Possible Importunity, Germanicus , Who Commanded Them, To Take The Government On Himself, Though He Obstinately Refused It. It Was Tiberius’s Apprehension From This Quarter, Which Made Him Request The Senate To Assign Him Some Part Only In The Administration, Such As They Should Judge Proper, Since No Man Could Be Sufficient For The Whole, Without One Or More To Assist Him. He Pretended Likewise To Be In A Bad State Of Health, That Germanicus Might The More Patiently Wait In Hopes Of Speedily Succeeding Him, Or At Least Of Being  Admitted To Be A Colleague In The Government. When The Mutinies In The Armies Were Suppressed, He Got Clemens Into His Hands By Stratagem. That He Might Not Begin His Reign By An Act Of Severity, He Did Not Call Libo To An Account Before The Senate Until His Second Year, Being Content, In The Mean Time, With Taking Proper Precautions For His Own Security. For Upon Libo’s Attending A Sacrifice Amongst The High-priests, Instead Of The Usual Knife, He Ordered One Of Lead To Be Given Him; And When He Desired A Private Conference With Him, He Would Not Grant His Request, But On Condition That His Son Drusus Should Be Present; And As They Walked Together, He Held Him Fast By The Right Hand, Under The Pretence Of Leaning Upon Him, Until The Conversation Was Over.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
