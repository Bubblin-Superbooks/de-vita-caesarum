Though In The Highest Degree Of Favour With Augustus, He Never Aspired Beyond The Rank Of The Equestrian Order; And Though He Might Have Held The Government Of Extensive Provinces By Deputies, He Was Content With Enjoying The Praefecture Of The City And Italy; A Situation, However, Which Must Have Been Attended With Extensive Patronage. He Was Of A Gay And Social Disposition. In Principle He Is Said To Have Been Of The Epicurean Sect, And In His Dress And Manners To Have Bordered On Effeminacy.

The Liberal Patronage Which He Displayed Towards Men Of Genius And Talents, Will Render His Name For Ever Celebrated In The Annals Of Learning. It Is To Be Regretted That History Has Transmitted No Particulars Of This Extraordinary Personage, Of Whom All We Know Is Derived Chiefly From The Writings Of Virgil And Horace; But From The Manner In Which They Address Him, Amidst The Familiarity Of Their Intercourse, There Is The Strongest Reason To Suppose, That He Was Not Less Amiable And Respectable In Private Life, Than Illustrious In Public Situation. “O My Glory!” Is The Emphatic Expression Employed By Them Both.</h4></div> </div>
