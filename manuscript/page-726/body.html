<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="  start-chapter">Neron, Orestaes, Alkmaion, maetroktonai.
Neonymphon  Neron, idian maeter apekteinen.</p><p>Orestes and Alcaeon—Nero too,
The lustful Nero, worst of all the crew,
Fresh from his bridal—their own mothers slew.</p><p>Quis neget Aeneae magna de stirpe Neronem?
Sustulit hic matrem: sustulit  ille patrem.</p><p>Sprung from Aeneas, pious, wise and great,
Who says that Nero is degenerate?
Safe through the flames, one bore his sire; the other,
To save himself, took off his loving mother.</p><p>Dum tendit citharam noster, dum cornua Parthus,
Noster erit Paean, ille Ekataebeletaes.</p></div> </div>
