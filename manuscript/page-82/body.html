He Never Marched His Army By Roads Which Were Exposed To Ambuscades, Without Having Previously Examined The Nature Of The Ground By His Scouts. Nor Did He Cross Over To Britain, Before He Had Carefully Examined, In Person , The Navigation, The Harbours, And The Most Convenient Point Of Landing In The Island. When Intelligence Was Brought To Him Of The Siege Of His Camp In Germany, He Made His Way To His Troops, Through The Enemy’s Stations, In A Gaulish Dress.
