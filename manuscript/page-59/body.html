To Every Foot-soldier In His Veteran Legions, Besides The Two Thousand Sesterces Paid Him In The Beginning Of The Civil War, He Gave Twenty Thousand More, In The Shape Of Prize-money. He Likewise Allotted Them Lands, But Not In Contiguity, That The Former Owners Might Not Be Entirely Dispossessed. To The People Of Rome, Besides Ten Modii Of Corn, And As Many Pounds Of Oil, He Gave Three Hundred Sesterces A Man, Which He Had Formerly Promised Them, And A Hundred More To Each For The Delay In Fulfilling His Engagement. He Likewise Remitted A Yearâ€™s Rent Due To The Treasury, For Such Houses In Rome As Did Not Pay Above Two Thousand Sesterces A Year; And Through The Rest Of Italy, For All Such As Did Not Exceed In Yearly Rent Five Hundred Sesterces. To All This He Added A Public Entertainment, And A Distribution Of Meat, And, After His Spanish Victory , Two Public Dinners. For, Considering The First He Had Given As Too Sparing, And Unsuited To His Profuse Liberality, He, Five Days Afterwards, Added Another, Which Was Most Plentiful.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
