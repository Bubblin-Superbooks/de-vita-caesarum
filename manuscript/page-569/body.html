<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xxvii. He Evinced The Savage Barbarity Of His Temper Chiefly By The Following Indications. When Flesh Was Only To Be Had At A High Price For Feeding His Wild Beasts Reserved For The Spectacles, He Ordered That Criminals Should Be Given Them  To Be Devoured; And Upon Inspecting Them In A Row, While He Stood In The Middle Of The Portico, Without Troubling Himself To Examine Their Cases He Ordered Them To Be Dragged Away, From “Bald-pate To Bald-pate.”  Of One Person Who Had Made A Vow For His Recovery To Combat With A Gladiator, He Exacted Its Performance; Nor Would He Allow Him To Desist Until He Came Off Conqueror, And After Many Entreaties. Another, Who Had Vowed To Give His Life For The Same Cause, Having Shrunk From The Sacrifice, He Delivered, Adorned As A Victim, With Garlands And Fillets, To Boys, Who Were To Drive Him Through The Streets, Calling On Him To Fulfil His Vow, Until He Was Thrown Headlong From The Ramparts. After Disfiguring Many Persons Of Honourable Rank, By Branding Them In The Face With Hot Irons, He Condemned Them To The Mines, To Work In Repairing The High-ways, Or To Fight With Wild Beasts; Or Tying Them By The Neck And Heels, In The Manner Of Beasts Carried To Slaughter, Would Shut Them Up In Cages, Or Saw Them Asunder. Nor Were These Severities Merely Inflicted For Crimes Of Great Enormity, But For Making Remarks On His Public Games, Or For Not Having Sworn By The Genius Of The Emperor. He Compelled Parents To Be Present At The Execution Of Their Sons; And To One Who Excused Himself On Account Of Indisposition, He Sent His Own Litter. Another He Invited To His Table Immediately After He Had Witnessed The Spectacle, And Coolly Challenged Him To Jest And Be Merry. He Ordered The Overseer Of The Spectacles And Wild Beasts To Be Scourged In Fetters, During Several Days Successively, In His Own Presence, And Did Not Put Him To Death Until He Was Disgusted With The Stench Of His Putrefied Brain. He Burned Alive, In The Centre Of The Arena Of The Amphitheatre, The Writer Of A Farce, For Some Witty Verse, Which Had A Double Meaning. A Roman Knight, Who Had Been Exposed To The Wild Beasts, Crying Out That He Was Innocent, He Called Him Back, And Having Had His Tongue Cut Out, Remanded Him To The Arena.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
