He Put To Death A Scholar Of Paris, The Pantomimic , Though A Minor, And Then Sick, Only Because, Both In Person And The Practice Of His Art, He Resembled His Master; As He Did Likewise Hermogenes Of Tarsus For Some Oblique Reflections In His History; Crucifying, Besides, The Scribes Who Had Copied The Work. One Who Was Master Of A Band Of Gladiators, Happening To Say, “That A Thrax Was A Match For A Marmillo , But Not So For The Exhibitor Of The Games”, He Ordered Him To Be Dragged From The Benches Into The Arena, And Exposed To The Dogs, With This Label Upon Him, “A Parmularian  Guilty Of Talking Impiously.” He Put To Death Many Senators, And Amongst Them Several Men Of Consular Rank. In This Number Were, Civica Cerealis, When He Was Proconsul In Africa, Salvidienus Orfitus, And Acilius Glabrio In Exile, Under The Pretence Of Their Planning To Revolt Against Him. The Rest He Punished Upon Very Trivial Occasions; As Aelius Lamia For Some Jocular Expressions, Which Were Of Old Date, And Perfectly Harmless; Because, Upon His Commending His Voice After He Had Taken His Wife From Him , He Replied, “Alas! I Hold My Tongue.” And When Titus Advised Him To Take Another Wife, He Answered Him Thus: “What! Have You A Mind To Marry?” Salvius Cocceianus Was Condemned To Death For Keeping The Birth-day Of His Uncle Otho, The Emperor: Metius Pomposianus, Because He Was Commonly Reported To Have An Imperial Nativity , And To Carry About With  Him A Map Of The World Upon Vellum, With The Speeches Of Kings And Generals Extracted Out Of Titus Livius; And For Giving His Slaves The Names Of Mago And Hannibal; Sallustius Lucullus, Lieutenant In Britain, For Suffering Some Lances Of A New Invention To Be Called “Lucullean;” And Junius Rusticus, For Publishing A Treatise In Praise Of Paetus Thrasea And Helvidius Priscus, And Calling Them Both “Most Upright Men.” Upon This Occasion, He Likewise Banished All The Philosophers From The City And Italy. He Put To Death The Younger Helvidius, For Writing A Farce, In Which, Under The Character Of Paris And Oenone, He Reflected Upon His Having Divorced His Wife; And Also Flavius Sabinus, One Of His Cousins, Because, Upon His Being Chosen At The Consular Election To That Office, The Public Crier Had, By A Blunder, Proclaimed Him To The People Not Consul, But Emperor. Becoming Still More Savage After His Success In The Civil War, He Employed The Utmost Industry To Discover Those Of The Adverse Party Who Absconded: Many Of Them He Racked With A New-invented Torture, Inserting Fire Through Their Private Parts; And From Some He Cut Off Their Hands. It Is Certain, That Only Two Of Any Note Were Pardoned, A Tribune Who Wore The Narrow Stripe, And A Centurion; Who, To Clear Themselves From The Charge Of Being Concerned In Any Rebellious Project, Proved Themselves To Have Been Guilty Of Prostitution, And Consequently Incapable Of Exercising Any Influence Either Over The General Or The Soldiers.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
