He Expired In The Same Room In Which His Father Octavius Had Died, When The Two Sextus’s, Pompey And Apuleius, Were Consuls, Upon The Fourteenth Of The Calends Of September [The 19Th August], At The Ninth Hour Of The Day, Being Seventy-six Years Of Age, Wanting Only Thirty-five Days . His Remains Were Carried By The Magistrates Of The Municipal  Towns And Colonies, From Nola To Bovillae , And In The Nighttime, Because Of The Season Of The Year. During The Intervals, The Body Lay In Some Basilica, Or Great Temple, Of Each Town. At Bovillae It Was Met By The Equestrian Order, Who Carried It To The City, And Deposited It In The Vestibule Of His Own House. The Senate Proceeded With So Much Zeal In The Arrangement Of His Funeral, And Paying Honour To His Memory, That, Amongst Several Other Proposals, Some Were For Having The Funeral Procession Made Through The Triumphal Gate, Preceded By The Image Of Victory Which Is In The Senate-house, And The Children Of Highest Rank And Of Both Sexes Singing The Funeral  Dirge. Others Proposed, That On The Day Of The Funeral, They Should Lay Aside Their Gold Rings, And Wear Rings Of Iron; And Others, That His Bones Should Be Collected By The Priests Of The Principal Colleges. One Likewise Proposed To Transfer The Name Of August To September, Because He Was Born In The Latter, But Died In The Former. Another Moved, That The Whole Period Of Time, From His Birth To His Death, Should Be Called The Augustan Age, And Be Inserted In The Calendar Under That Title. But At Last It Was Judged Proper To Be Moderate In The Honours Paid To His Memory. Two Funeral Orations Were Pronounced In His Praise, One Before The Temple Of Julius, By Tiberius; And The Other Before The Rostra, Under The Old Shops, By Drusus, Tiberius’s Son. The Body Was Then Carried Upon The Shoulders Of Senators Into The Campus Martius, And There Burnt. A Man Of Pretorian Rank Affirmed Upon Oath, That He Saw His Spirit Ascend From The Funeral Pile To Heaven. The Most Distinguished Persons Of The Equestrian Order, Bare-footed, And With Their Tunics Loose, Gathered Up His Relics , And Deposited Them In The Mausoleum, Which Had Been Built In His Sixth Consulship Between The Flaminian Way And The Bank Of The Tiber ; At Which Time Likewise He Gave The Groves And Walks About It For The Use Of The People.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
