Four-and-twenty Times, He Says, He Treated The People With Games Upon His Own Account, And Three-and-twenty Times For Such Magistrates As Were Either Absent, Or Not Able To Afford The Expense. The Performances Took Place Sometimes In The Different Streets Of The City, And Upon Several Stages, By Players In All Languages. The Same He Did Not Only In The Forum And Amphitheatre, But In The Circus Likewise, And In The Septa : And Sometimes He Exhibited Only The Hunting Of Wild Beasts. He Entertained The People With Wrestlers In The Campus Martius, Where Wooden Seats Were Erected For The Purpose; And Also With A Naval Fight, For Which He Excavated The Ground Near The Tiber, Where There Is Now The Grove Of The Caesars. During These Two Entertainments He Stationed Guards In The City, Lest, By Robbers Taking Advantage Of The Small Number Of People Left At Home, It Might Be Exposed To Depredations. In The Circus He Exhibited Chariot And Foot Races, And Combats With Wild Beasts, In Which The Performers Were Often Youths Of The Highest Rank. His Favourite Spectacle Was The Trojan Game, Acted By A Select Number Of Boys, In Parties Differing In Age And Station; Thinking  That It Was A Practice Both Excellent In Itself, And Sanctioned By Ancient Usage, That The Spirit Of The Young Nobles Should Be Displayed In Such Exercises. Caius Nonius Asprenas, Who Was Lamed By A Fall In This Diversion, He Presented With A Gold Collar, And Allowed Him And His Posterity To Bear The Surname Of Torquati. But Soon Afterwards He Gave Up The Exhibition Of This Game, In Consequence Of A Severe And Bitter Speech Made In The Senate By Asinius Pollio, The Orator, In Which He Complained Bitterly Of The Misfortune Of Aeserninus, His Grandson, Who Likewise Broke His Leg In The Same Diversion.</h4></div> </div>
