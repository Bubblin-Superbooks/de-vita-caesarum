<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xiv. Immediately On His Entering The City, By The Joint Acclamations Of The Senate, And People, Who Broke Into The Senate-house, Tiberiusâ€™s Will Was Set Aside, It Having Left His  Other Grandson , Then A Minor, Coheir With Him, The Whole Government And Administration Of Affairs Was Placed In His Hands; So Much To The Joy And Satisfaction Of The Public, That, In Less Than Three Months After, Above A Hundred And Sixty Thousand Victims Are Said To Have Been Offered In Sacrifice. Upon His Going, A Few Days Afterwards, To The Nearest Islands On The Coast Of Campania , Vows Were Made For His Safe Return; Every Person Emulously Testifying Their Care And Concern For His Safety. And When He Fell Ill, The People Hung About The Palatium All Night Long; Some Vowed, In Public Handbills, To Risk Their Lives In The Combats Of The Amphitheatre, And Others To Lay Them Down, For His Recovery. To This Extraordinary Love Entertained For Him By His Countrymen, Was Added An Uncommon Regard By Foreign Nations. Even Artabanus, King Of The Parthians, Who Had Always Manifested Hatred And Contempt For Tiberius, Solicited His Friendship; Came To Hold A Conference With His Consular Lieutenant, And Passing The Euphrates, Paid The Highest Honours To The Eagles, The Roman Standards, And The Images Of The Caesars.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
