<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Vi. Caius Albutius Silus, Of Novara , While, In The Execution  Of The Office Of Edile In His Native Place, He Was Sitting For The Administration Of Justice, Was Dragged By The Feet From The Tribunal By Some Persons Against Whom He Was Pronouncing A Decree. In Great Indignation At This Usage, He Made Straight For The Gate Of The Town, And Proceeded To Rome. There He Was Admitted To Fellowship, And Lodged, With Plancus The Orator , Whose Practice It Was, Before He Made A Speech In Public, To Set Up Some One To Take The Contrary Side In The Argument. The Office Was Undertaken By Albutius With Such Success, That He Silenced Plancus, Who Did Not Venture To Put Himself In Competition With Him. This Bringing Him Into Notice, He Collected An Audience Of His Own, And It Was His Custom To Open The Question Proposed For Debate, Sitting; But As He Warmed With The Subject, He Stood Up, And Made His Peroration In That Posture. His Declamations Were Of Different Kinds; Sometimes Brilliant And Polished, At Others, That They Might Not Be Thought To Savour Too Much Of The Schools, He Curtailed Them Of All Ornament, And Used Only Familiar Phrases. He Also Pleaded Causes, But Rarely, Being Employed In Such As Were Of The Highest Importance, And In Every Case Undertaking The Peroration Only.</h4></div> </div>
