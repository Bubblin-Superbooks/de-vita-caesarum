He Filled Up The Vacancies In The Senate, By Advancing Several Plebeians To The Rank Of Patricians, And Also Increased The Number Of Praetors, Aediles, Quaestors, And Inferior Magistrates; Restoring, At The Same Time, Such As Had Been Degraded By The Censors, Or Convicted Of Bribery At Elections. The Choice Of Magistrates He So Divided With The People, That, Excepting Only The Candidates For The Consulship, They Nominated One Half Of Them, And He The Other. The Method Which He Practised In Those Cases Was, To Recommend Such Persons As He Had Pitched Upon, By Bills Dispersed Through The Several Tribes To This Effect: “Caesar The Dictator To Such A Tribe , That By The Favour Of Your Votes They May Attain To The Honours For Which They Sue.” He Likewise Admitted To Offices The Sons Of Those Who Had Been Proscribed. The Trial Of Causes He Restricted To Two Orders Of Judges, The Equestrian And Senatorial; Excluding The Tribunes Of The Treasury Who Had Before Made A Third Class. The Revised Census Of The People He Ordered To Be Taken Neither In The Usual Manner Or Place, But Street By Street, By The Principal Inhabitants Of The Several Quarters Of The City; And He Reduced The Number Of Those Who Received Corn At The Public Cost, From Three Hundred And Twenty, To A Hundred And Fifty, Thousand. To Prevent Any Tumults On Account Of The Census, He Ordered That The Praetor Should Every Year Fill Up By Lot The Vacancies Occasioned By Death, From Those Who Were Not Enrolled For The Receipt Of Corn.</h4></div> </div>
