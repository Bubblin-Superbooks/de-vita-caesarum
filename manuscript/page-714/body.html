He Thought There Was No Other Use Of Riches And Money Than To Squander Them Away Profusely; Regarding All Those As Sordid Wretches Who Kept Their Expenses Within Due Bounds; And Extolling Those As Truly Noble And Generous Souls, Who Lavished Away And Wasted All They Possessed. He Praised And Admired His Uncle Caius , Upon No Account More, Than For Squandering In A Short Time The Vast Treasure Left Him By Tiberius. Accordingly, He Was Himself Extravagant And Profuse, Beyond All Bounds. He Spent Upon Tiridates Eight Hundred Thousand Sesterces A Day, A Sum Almost Incredible; And At His Departure, Presented Him With Upwards Of A Million . He Likewise Bestowed Upon Menecrates The Harper, And Spicillus A Gladiator, The Estates And Houses Of Men Who Had Received The Honour Of A Triumph. He Enriched The Usurer Cercopithecus Panerotes With Estates Both In Town And Country; And Gave Him A Funeral, In Pomp And Magnificence Little Inferior To That Of Princes. He Never Wore The Same Garment Twice. He  Has Been Known To Stake Four Hundred Thousand Sesterces On A Throw Of The Dice. It Was His Custom To Fish With A Golden Net, Drawn By Silken Cords Of Purple And Scarlet. It Is Said, That He Never Travelled With Less Than A Thousand Baggage-carts; The Mules Being All Shod With Silver, And The Drivers Dressed In Scarlet Jackets Of The Finest Canusian Cloth , With A Numerous Train Of Footmen, And Troops Of Mazacans , With Bracelets On Their Arms, And Mounted Upon Horses In Splendid Trappings.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
