<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>I. Germanicus, The Father Of Caius Caesar, And Son Of Drusus And The Younger Antonia, Was, After His Adoption By Tiberius, His Uncle, Preferred To The Quaestorship  Five Years Before He Had Attained The Legal Age, And Immediately Upon The Expiration Of That Office, To The Consulship . Having Been Sent To The Army In Germany, He Restored Order Among The Legions, Who, Upon The News Of Augustusâ€™s Death, Obstinately Refused To Acknowledge Tiberius As Emperor , And Offered To Place Him At The Head Of The State. In Which Affair It Is Difficult To Say, Whether His Regard To Filial Duty, Or The Firmness Of His Resolution, Was Most Conspicuous. Soon Afterwards He Defeated The Enemy, And Obtained The Honours Of A Triumph. Being Then Made Consul For The Second Time , Before He Could Enter Upon His Office He Was Obliged To Set Out Suddenly For The East, Where, After He Had Conquered The King Of Armenia, And Reduced Cappadocia Into The Form Of A Province, He Died At Antioch, Of A Lingering Distemper, In The Thirty-fourth Year Of His Age , Not Without The Suspicion Of Being Poisoned. For Besides The Livid Spots Which Appeared All Over His Body, And A Foaming At The Mouth; When His Corpse Was Burnt, The Heart Was Found Entire Among The Bones; Its Nature Being Such, As It Is Supposed, That When Tainted By Poison, It Is Indestructible By Fire.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
