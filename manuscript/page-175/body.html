In This War , Hirtius Being Slain In Battle, And Pansa Dying A Short Time Afterwards Of A Wound, A Report Was Circulated That They Both Were Killed Through His Means, In Order That, When Antony Fled, The Republic Having Lost Its Consuls, He Might Have The Victorious Armies Entirely At His Own Command. The Death Of Pansa Was So Fully Believed To Have Been Caused By Undue Means, That Glyco, His Surgeon, Was Placed In Custody, On A Suspicion Of Having Poisoned His Wound. And To This, Aquilius Niger Adds, That He Killed Hirtius, The Other Consul, In The Confusion Of The Battle, With His Own Hands.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
