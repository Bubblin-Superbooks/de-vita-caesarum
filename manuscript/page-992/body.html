<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Iii. Lucius Aelius Had A Double Cognomen, For He Was Called Praeconius, Because His Father Was A Herald; Stilo, Because He Was In The Habit Of Composing Orations For Most Of The Speakers Of Highest Rank; Indeed, He Was So Strong A Partisan Of The Nobles, That He Accompanied Quintus Metellus Numidicus  In His Exile. Servius  Having Clandestinely Obtained His Father-in-law’s Book Before It Was Published, Was Disowned For The Fraud, Which He Took So Much To Heart, That, Overwhelmed With Shame And Distress, He Retired From Rome; And Being Seized With A Fit Of The Gout, In His Impatience, He Applied A Poisonous Ointment To His Feet, Which Half-killed Him, So That His Lower Limbs Mortified While He Was Still Alive. After This, More Attention Was Paid To The Science Of Letters, And It Grew In Public Estimation, Insomuch, That Men Of The Highest Rank Did Not Hesitate In Undertaking To Write Something On The Subject; And It Is Related That Sometimes There Were No Less Than Twenty Celebrated Scholars In Rome. So High Was The Value, And So Great Were The Rewards, Of Grammarians, That Lutatius Daphnides, Jocularly Called “Pan’s Herd”  By Lenaeus Melissus, Was Purchased By Quintus Catullus For Two Hundred Thousand Sesterces, And Shortly Afterwards Made A Freedman; And That Lucius Apuleius, Who Was Taken Into The Pay Of Epicius Calvinus, A Wealthy Roman Knight, At The Annual Salary Of Ten Thousand Crowns, Had Many Scholars. Grammar Also Penetrated Into The Provinces, And Some Of The Most Eminent Amongst The Learned Taught It In Foreign Parts, Particularly In Gallia Togata. In The Number Of These, We May Reckon Octavius  Teucer, Siscennius Jacchus, And Oppius Cares , Who Persisted In Teaching To A Most Advanced Period Of His Life, At A Time When He Was Not Only Unable To Walk, But His Sight Failed.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
