<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xv. Upon His Return To Rome, Having Introduced His Son Drusus Into The Forum, He Immediately Removed From Pompey’s House, In The Carinae, To The Gardens Of Mecaenas, On The Esquiline , And Resigned Himself Entirely To His Ease, Performing Only The Common Offices Of Civility In Private Life, Without Any Preferment In The Government. But Caius And Lucius Being Both Carried Off In The Space Of Three Years, He Was Adopted By Augustus, Along With Their Brother Agrippa; Being Obliged In The First Place To Adopt Germanicus, His Brother’s Son. After His Adoption, He Never More Acted As Master Of A  Family, Nor Exercised, In The Smallest Degree, The Rights Which He Had Lost By It. For He Neither Disposed Of Anything In The Way Of Gift, Nor Manumitted A Slave; Nor So Much As Received Any Estate Left Him By Will, Nor Any Legacy, Without Reckoning It As A Part Of His Peculium Or Property Held Under His Father. From That Day Forward, Nothing Was Omitted That Might Contribute To The Advancement Of His Grandeur, And Much More, When, Upon Agrippa Being Discarded And Banished, It Was Evident That The Hope Of Succession Rested Upon Him Alone.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
