He Was Tall, Of A Pale Complexion, Ill-shaped, His Neck And Legs Very Slender, His Eyes And Temples Hollow, His Brows Broad And Knit, His Hair Thin, And The Crown Of The Head Bald. The Other Parts Of His Body Were Much Covered With Hair. On This Account, It Was Reckoned A Capital Crime For Any Person To Look Down From Above, As He Was Passing By, Or So Much As To Name A Goat. His Countenance, Which Was Naturally Hideous And Frightful, He Purposely Rendered More So, Forming It Before A Mirror Into The Most Horrible Contortions. He Was Crazy Both In Body And Mind, Being Subject, When A Boy, To The Falling Sickness. When He Arrived At The Age Of Manhood, He Endured Fatigue Tolerably Well; But Still, Occasionally, He Was Liable To A Faintness, During Which He Remained Incapable Of Any Effort. He Was Not Insensible Of The Disorder Of His Mind, And Sometimes Had Thoughts Of Retiring To Clear His Brain . It Is Believed That His Wife Caesonia Administered To Him A Love Potion Which Threw Him Into A Frenzy. What Most Of All Disordered Him, Was Want Of Sleep, For He Seldom Had More Than Three Or Four Hoursâ€™ Rest In A Night; And Even Then His Sleep Was Not Sound, But Disturbed By Strange Dreams; Fancying, Among Other Things, That A Form Representing The Ocean Spoke To Him. Being Therefore Often Weary With Lying Awake So Long, Sometimes He Sat Up In His Bed, At Others, Walked In The Longest Porticos About The House, And From Time To Time, Invoked And Looked Out For The Approach Of Day.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
