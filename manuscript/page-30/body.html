He Even Struck Such Terror Into Those Who Were Advocates For Greater Severity, By Representing To Them What Universal Odium Would Be Attached To Their Memories By The Roman People, That Decius Silanus, Consul Elect, Did Not Hesitate To Qualify His Proposal, It Not Being Very Honourable To Change It, By A Lenient Interpretation; As If It Had Been Understood In A Harsher Sense Than He Intended, And Caesar Would Certainly Have Carried His Point, Having Brought Over To His Side A Great Number Of The Senators, Among Whom Was Cicero, The Consulâ€™s Brother, Had Not A Speech By Marcus Cato Infused New Vigour Into The Resolutions Of The Senate. He Persisted, However, In Obstructing The Measure, Until A Body Of The Roman Knights, Who Stood Under Arms As A Guard, Threatened Him With Instant Death, If He Continued His Determined Opposition. They Even Thrust At Him With Their Drawn Swords, So That Those Who Sat Next Him Moved Away;  And A Few Friends, With No Small Difficulty, Protected Him, By Throwing Their Arms Round Him, And Covering Him With Their Togas.
