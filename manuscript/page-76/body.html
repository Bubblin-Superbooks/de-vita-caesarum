In The Number Of His Mistresses Were Also Some Queens; Such As Eunoe, A Moor, The Wife Of Bogudes, To Whom And Her Husband He Made, As Naso Reports, Many Large Presents. But His Greatest Favourite Was Cleopatra, With Whom He Often Revelled All Night Until The Dawn Of Day, And Would Have Gone With Her Through Egypt In Dalliance, As Far As Aethiopia, In Her Luxurious Yacht, Had Not The Army Refused To Follow Him. He Afterwards Invited Her To Rome, Whence He Sent Her Back Loaded With Honours And Presents, And Gave Her Permission To Call By His Name A Son, Who, According To The Testimony Of Some Greek Historians, Resembled Caesar Both In Person And Gait. Mark Antony Declared In The Senate, That Caesar Had Acknowledged The Child As His Own; And That Caius Matias, Caius Oppius, And The Rest Of Caesar’s Friends Knew It To Be True. On Which Occasion, Oppius, As If It Had Been An Imputation Which He Was Called Upon To Refute, Published A Book To Shew, “That The Child Which Cleopatra Fathered Upon Caesar, Was Not His.” Helvius Cinna, Tribune Of The People, Admitted To Several Persons The Fact, That He Had A Bill Ready Drawn, Which Caesar Had Ordered Him To Get Enacted In His Absence, Allowing Him, With The Hope Of Leaving Issue, To Take Any Wife He Chose, And As Many Of Them As He Pleased; And To Leave No Room For Doubt Of His Infamous Character For Unnatural Lewdness And Adultery, Curio, The Father, Says, In One Of His Speeches, “He Was Every Woman’s Man, And Every Man’s Woman.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
