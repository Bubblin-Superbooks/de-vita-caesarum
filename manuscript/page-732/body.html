At The First Breaking Out Of These Troubles, It Is Believed That He Had Formed Many Designs Of A Monstrous Nature, Although Conformable Enough To His Natural Disposition. These Were To Send New Governors And Commanders To The Provinces And The Armies, And Employ Assassins To Butcher All The Former Governors And Commanders, As Men Unanimously Engaged In A Conspiracy Against Him; To Massacre The Exiles In Every Quarter, And All The Gaulish Population In Rome; The Former Lest They Should Join The Insurrection; The Latter As Privy To The Designs Of Their Countrymen, And Ready To Support  Them; To Abandon Gaul Itself, To Be Wasted And Plundered By His Armies; To Poison The Whole Senate At A Feast; To Fire The City, And Then Let Loose The Wild Beasts Upon The People, In Order To Impede Their Stopping The Progress Of The Flames. But Being Deterred From The Execution Of These Designs Not So Much By Remorse Of Conscience, As By Despair Of Being Able To Effect Them, And Judging An Expedition Into Gaul Necessary, He Removed The Consuls From Their Office, Before The Time Of Its Expiration Was Arrived; And In Their Room Assumed The Consulship Himself Without A Colleague, As If The Fates Had Decreed That Gaul Should Not Be Conquered, But By A Consul. Upon Assuming The Fasces, After An Entertainment At The Palace, As He Walked Out Of The Room Leaning On The Arms Of Some Of His Friends, He Declared, That As Soon As He Arrived In The Province, He Would Make His Appearance Amongst The Troops, Unarmed, And Do Nothing But Weep: And That, After He Had Brought The Mutineers To Repentance, He Would, The Next Day, In The Public Rejoicings, Sing Songs Of Triumph, Which He Must Now, Without Loss Of Time, Apply Himself To Compose.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
