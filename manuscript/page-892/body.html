He Gave Apollinaris, The Tragedian, Four Hundred Thousand Sesterces, And To Terpinus And Diodorus, The Harpers, Two Hundred Thousand; To Some A Hundred Thousand; And The Least He Gave To Any Of The Performers Was Forty Thousand, Besides Many Golden Crowns. He Entertained Company Constantly At His Table, And Often In Great State And Very Sumptuously, In Order To Promote Trade. As In The Saturnalia He Made Presents To The Men Which They Were To Carry Away With Them, So Did He To The Women Upon The Calends Of March ; Notwithstanding Which, He Could Not Wipe Off The Disrepute Of His Former Stinginess. The Alexandrians Called Him Constantly Cybiosactes; A Name Which Had Been Given To One Of Their Kings Who Was Sordidly Avaricious. Nay, At His Funeral, Favo, The Principal Mimic, Personating Him, And Imitating, As Actors Do, Both His Manner Of Speaking And His Gestures, Asked Aloud Of The Procurators, “How Much His Funeral And The Procession Would Cost?” And Being Answered “Ten Millions Of Sesterces,” He Cried Out, “Give Him But A Hundred Thousand Sesterces, And They Might Throw His Body Into The Tiber, If They Would.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
