Being Then Chosen Augur In The Room Of His Brother Drusus, Before He Could Be Inaugurated He Was Advanced To The Pontificate, With No Small Commendation Of His Dutiful Behaviour, And Great Capacity. The Situation Of The Court Likewise Was At This Time Favourable To His Fortunes, As It Was Now Left Destitute Of Support, Sejanus Being Suspected, And Soon Afterwards Taken Off; And He Was By Degrees Flattered With The Hope Of Succeeding Tiberius In The Empire. In Order More Effectually To Secure This Object, Upon Junia’s Dying In Child-bed, He Engaged In A Criminal Commerce With Ennia Naevia, The Wife  Of Macro, At That Time Prefect Of The Pretorian Cohorts; Promising To Marry Her If He Became Emperor, To Which He Bound Himself, Not Only By An Oath, But By A Written Obligation Under His Hand. Having By Her Means Insinuated Himself Into Macro’s Favour, Some Are Of Opinion That He Attempted To Poison Tiberius, And Ordered His Ring To Be Taken From Him, Before The Breath Was Out Of His Body; And That, Because He Seemed To Hold It Fast, He Caused A Pillow To Be Thrown Upon Him , Squeezing Him By The Throat, At The Same Time, With His Own Hand. One Of His Freedmen Crying Out At This Horrid Barbarity, He Was Immediately Crucified. These Circumstances Are Far From Being Improbable, As Some Authors Relate That, Afterwards, Though He Did Not Acknowledge His Having A Hand In The Death Of Tiberius, Yet He Frankly Declared That He Had Formerly Entertained Such A Design; And As A Proof Of His Affection For His Relations, He Would Frequently Boast, “That, To Revenge The Death Of His Mother And Brothers, He Had Entered The Chamber Of Tiberius, When He Was Asleep, With A Poniard, But Being Seized With A Fit Of Compassion, Threw It Away, And Retired; And That Tiberius, Though Aware Of His Intention, Durst Not Make Any Inquiries, Or Attempt Revenge.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
