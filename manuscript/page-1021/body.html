<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xxi. Caius Melissus , A Native Of Spoletum, Was Free-born, But Having Been Exposed By His Parents In Consequence Of Quarrels Between Them, He Received A Good Education From His Foster-father, By Whose Care And Industry He Was Brought Up, And Was Made A Present Of To Mecaenas, As A Grammarian. Finding Himself Valued And Treated As A Friend, He Preferred To Continue In His State Of Servitude, Although He Was Claimed By His Mother, Choosing Rather His Present Condition Than That Which His Real Origin Entitled Him To. In Consequence, His Freedom Was Speedily Given Him, And He Even Became A Favourite With Augustus. By His Appointment He Was Made Curator Of The Library In The Portico Of Octavia ; And, As He Himself Informs Us, Undertook To Compose, When He Was A Sexagenarian, His Books Of “Witticisms,” Which Are Now Called “The Book Of Jests.” Of These He Accomplished One Hundred And Fifty, To Which He Afterwards Added Several More. He  Also Composed A New Kind Of Story About Those Who Wore The Toga, And Called It “Trabeat.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
