Sensible Of His Being Subject To Passion And Resentment, He Excused Himself In Both Instances By A Proclamation, Assuring The Public That “The Former Should Be Short And Harmless, And The Latter Never Without Good Cause.” After Severely Reprimanding The People Of Ostia For Not Sending Some Boats To Meet Him Upon His Entering The Mouth Of The Tiber, In Terms Which Might Expose Them To The Public Resentment, He Wrote To Rome That He Had Been Treated As A Private Person; Yet Immediately Afterwards He Pardoned Them, And That In A Way Which Had The Appearance Of Making Them  Satisfaction, Or Begging Pardon For Some Injury He Had Done Them. Some People Who Addressed Him Unseasonably In Public, He Pushed Away With His Own Hand. He Likewise Banished A Person Who Had Been Secretary To A Quaestor, And Even A Senator Who Had Filled The Office Of Praetor, Without A Hearing, And Although They Were Innocent; The Former Only Because He Had Treated Him With Rudeness While He Was In A Private Station, And The Other, Because In His Aedileship He Had Fined Some Tenants Of His, For Selling Cooked Victuals Contrary To Law, And Ordered His Steward, Who Interfered, To Be Whipped. On This Account, Likewise, He Took From The Aediles The Jurisdiction They Had Over Cooks’-shops. He Did Not Scruple To Speak Of His Own Absurdities, And Declared In Some Short Speeches Which He Published, That He Had Only Feigned Imbecility In The Reign Of Caius, Because Otherwise It Would Have Been Impossible For Him To Have Escaped And Arrived At The Station He Had Then Attained. He Could Not, However, Gain Credit For This Assertion; For A Short Time Afterwards, A Book Was Published Under The Title Of Moron Anastasis, “The Resurrection Of Fools,” The Design Of Which Was To Show “That Nobody Ever Counterfeited Folly.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
