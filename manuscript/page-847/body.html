<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Ii. It Is Certain, However, That Publius Vitellius, Of Nuceria, Whether Of An Ancient Family, Or Of Low Extraction, Was A Roman Knight, And A Procurator To Augustus. He Left Behind Him Four Sons, All Men Of Very High Station, Who Had The Same Cognomen, But The Different Praenomina Of Aulus, Quintus, Publius, And Lucius. Aulus Died In The Enjoyment Of The Consulship , Which Office He Bore Jointly With Domitius, The Father Of Nero Caesar. He Was Elegant To Excess In His Manner Of Living, And Notorious For The Vast Expense Of His Entertainments. Quintus Was Deprived Of His Rank Of Senator, When, Upon A Motion Made By Tiberius, A Resolution Passed To Purge The Senate Of Those Who Were In Any Respect Not Duly Qualified For That Honour. Publius, An Intimate Friend And Companion Of Germanicus, Prosecuted His Enemy And Murderer, Cneius Piso, And Procured Sentence Against Him. After He Had Been Made Proctor, Being Arrested Among The Accomplices Of Sejanus, And Delivered Into The Hands Of His Brother To Be Confined In His House, He Opened A Vein With A Penknife, Intending To Bleed Himself To Death. He Suffered, However, The Wound To Be Bound Up And Cured, Not So Much From Repenting The Resolution He Had Formed, As To Comply With The Importunity Of His Relations. He Died Afterwards A Natural Death During His Confinement. Lucius, After His Consulship , Was Made Governor Of Syria , And By His Politic Management Not Only Brought Artabanus, King Of The Parthians, To Give Him An Interview, But To Worship The Standards Of The Roman Legions. He Afterwards Filled Two Ordinary Consulships , And Also The Censorship  Jointly With The Emperor Claudius. Whilst That  Prince Was Absent Upon His Expedition Into Britain , The Care Of The Empire Was Committed To Him, Being A Man Of Great Integrity And Industry. But He Lessened His Character Not A Little, By His Passionate Fondness For An Abandoned Freedwoman, With Whose Spittle, Mixed With Honey, He Used To Anoint His Throat And Jaws, By Way Of Remedy For Some Complaint, Not Privately Nor Seldom, But Daily And Publicly. Being Extravagantly Prone To Flattery, It Was He Who Gave Rise To The Worship Of Caius Caesar As A God, When, Upon His Return From Syria, He Would Not Presume To Accost Him Any Otherwise Than With His Head Covered, Turning Himself Round, And Then Prostrating Himself Upon The Earth. And To Leave No Artifice Untried To Secure The Favour Of Claudius, Who Was Entirely Governed By His Wives And Freedmen, He Requested As The Greatest Favour From Messalina, That She Would Be Pleased To Let Him Take Off Her Shoes; Which, When He Had Done, He Took Her Right Shoe, And Wore It Constantly Betwixt His Toga And His Tunic, And From Time To Time Covered It With Kisses. He Likewise Worshipped Golden Images Of Narcissus And Pallas Among His Household Gods. It Was He, Too, Who, When Claudius Exhibited The Secular Games, In His Compliments To Him Upon That Occasion, Used This Expression, “May You Often Do The Same.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
