<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Ii. Crates Of Mallos , Then, Was, In Our Opinion, The First Who Introduced The Study Of Grammar At Rome. He Was Cotemporary With Aristarchus , And Having Been Sent By King Attalus As Envoy To The Senate In The Interval Between The Second And Third Punic Wars , Soon After The Death Of Ennius , He Had The Misfortune To Fall Into An Open Sewer In The Palatine Quarter Of The City, And Broke His Leg. After Which, During The Whole Period Of His Embassy And Convalescence, He Gave Frequent Lectures, Taking Much Pains To Instruct His Hearers, And He Has Left Us An Example Well Worthy Of Imitation. It Was So Far Followed, That Poems Hitherto Little Known, The Works Either Of Deceased Friends Or Other Approved Writers, Were Brought To Light, And Being Read And Commented On, Were Explained To Others. Thus, Caius Octavius Lampadio Edited The Punic War Of Naevius , Which Having Been Written In One Volume Without Any Break In The Manuscript, He Divided Into Seven Books. After That, Quintus Vargonteius Undertook The Annals Of Ennius, Which He Read On Certain Fixed Days To Crowded Audiences. So Laelius Archelaus, And Vectius Philocomus, Read And Commented On The Satires Of Their Friend Lucilius , Which Lenaeus Pompeius, A Freedman, Tells Us He Studied Under Archelaus; And Valerius Cato, Under Philocomus. Two Others Also Taught And Promoted  Grammar In Various Branches, Namely, Lucius Aelius Lanuvinus, The Son-in-law Of Quintus Aelius, And Servius Claudius, Both Of Whom Were Roman Knights, And Men Who Rendered Great Services Both To Learning And The Republic.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
