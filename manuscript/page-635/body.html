During A Scarcity Of Provisions, Occasioned By Bad Crops For Several Successive Years, He Was Stopped In The Middle Of The Forum By The Mob, Who So Abused Him, At The Same Time Pelting Him With Fragments Of Bread, That He Had Some  Difficulty In Escaping Into The Palace By A Back Door. He Therefore Used All Possible Means To Bring Provisions To The City, Even In The Winter. He Proposed To The Merchants A Sure Profit, By Indemnifying Them Against Any Loss That Might Befall Them By Storms At Sea; And Granted Great Privileges To Those Who Built Ships For That Traffic. To A Citizen Of Rome He Gave An Exemption From The Penalty Of The Papia-poppaean Law ; To One Who Had Only The Privilege Of Latium, The Freedom Of The City; And To Women The Rights Which By Law Belonged To Those Who Had Four Children: Which Enactments Are In Force To This Day.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
