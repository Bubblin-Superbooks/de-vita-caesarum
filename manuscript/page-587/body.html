Only Once In His Life Did He Take An Active Part In Military Affairs, And Then Not From Any Set Purpose, But During His Journey To Mevania, To See The Grove And River Of Clitumnus . Being Recommended To Recruit A Body Of Batavians, Who Attended Him, He Resolved Upon An Expedition Into Germany. Immediately He Drew Together Several Legions, And Auxiliary Forces From All Quarters, And Made Every Where New Levies With The Utmost Rigour. Collecting Supplies Of All Kinds, Such As Never Had Been Assembled Upon The Like Occasion, He Set Forward On His March, And Pursued It Sometimes With So Much Haste And Precipitation, That The Pretorian Cohorts Were Obliged, Contrary To Custom, To Pack Their Standards On Horses Or Mules, And So Follow Him.
