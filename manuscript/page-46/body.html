To Maintain His Alliance And Good Understanding With Pompey, He Offered Him In Marriage His Sisterâ€™s Grand-daughter Octavia, Who Had Been Married To Caius Marcellus; And Requested For Himself His Daughter, Lately Contracted To Faustus Sylla. Every Person About Him, And A Great Part Likewise Of The Senate, He Secured By Loans Of Money At Low Interest, Or None At All; And To All Others Who Came To Wait Upon Him, Either By Invitation Or Of Their Own Accord, He Made Liberal Presents; Not Neglecting Even The Freed-men And Slaves, Who Were Favourites With Their Masters And Patrons. He Offered Also Singular And Ready Aid To All Who Were Under Prosecution, Or In Debt, And To Prodigal Youths; Excluding From  His Bounty Those Only Who Were So Deeply Plunged In Guilt, Poverty, Or Luxury, That It Was Impossible Effectually To Relieve Them. These, He Openly Declared, Could Derive No Benefit From Any Other Means Than A Civil War.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
