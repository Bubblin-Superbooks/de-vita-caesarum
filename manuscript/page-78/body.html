But His Abstinence Did Not Extend To Pecuniary Advantages, Either In His Military Commands, Or Civil Offices; For We Have The Testimony Of Some Writers, That He Took Money From The Proconsul, Who Was His Predecessor In Spain, And From The Roman Allies In That Quarter, For The Discharge Of His Debts; And Plundered At The Point Of The Sword Some Towns Of The Lusitanians, Notwithstanding They Attempted No Resistance, And Opened Their Gates To Him Upon His Arrival Before Them. In Gaul, He Rifled The Chapels And Temples Of The Gods, Which Were Filled With Rich Offerings, And Demolished Cities Oftener For The Sake Of Their Spoil, Than For Any Ill They Had Done. By This Means Gold Became So Plentiful With Him, That He Exchanged It Through Italy And The Provinces Of The Empire For Three Thousand Sesterces The Pound. In His First Consulship He Purloined From The Capitol Three Thousand Poundsâ€™ Weight Of Gold, And Substituted For It The Same Quantity Of Gilt Brass. He Bartered Likewise To Foreign Nations And Princes, For Gold, The Titles Of Allies And Kings; And Squeezed Out Of Ptolemy Alone Near Six Thousand Talents, In The Name Of Himself And Pompey. He Afterwards Supported The Expense Of The Civil Wars, And Of His Triumphs And Public Spectacles, By The Most Flagrant Rapine And Sacrilege.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
