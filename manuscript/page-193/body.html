During Ten Years He Acted As One Of The Triumvirate For Settling The Commonwealth, In Which Office He For Some Time Opposed His Colleagues In Their Design Of A Proscription; But After It Was Begun, He Prosecuted It With More Determined Rigour Than Either Of Them. For Whilst They Were Often Prevailed Upon, By The Interest And Intercession Of Friends, To Shew Mercy, He Alone Strongly Insisted That No One Should Be Spared, And Even Proscribed Caius Toranius , His Guardian; Who Had  Been Formerly The Colleague Of His Father Octavius In The Aedileship. Junius Saturnius Adds This Farther Account Of Him: That When, After The Proscription Was Over, Marcus Lepidus Made An Apology In The Senate For Their Past Proceedings, And Gave Them Hopes Of A More Mild Administration For The Future, Because They Had Now Sufficiently Crushed Their Enemies; He, On The Other Hand, Declared That The Only Limit He Had Fixed To The Proscription Was, That He Should Be Free To Act As He Pleased. Afterwards, However, Repenting Of His Severity, He Advanced T. Vinius Philopoemen To The Equestrian Rank, For Having Concealed His Patron At The Time He Was Proscribed. In This Same Office He Incurred Great Odium Upon Many Accounts. For As He Was One Day Making An Harangue, Observing Among The Soldiers Pinarius, A Roman Knight, Admit Some Private Citizens, And Engaged In Taking Notes, He Ordered Him To Be Stabbed Before His Eyes, As A Busy-body And A Spy Upon Him. He So Terrified With His Menaces Tedius Afer, The Consul Elect , For Having Reflected Upon Some Action Of His, That He Threw Himself From A Great Height, And Died On The Spot. And When Quintus Gallius, The Praetor, Came To Compliment Him With A Double Tablet Under His Cloak, Suspecting That It Was A Sword He Had Concealed, And Yet Not Venturing To Make A Search, Lest It Should Be Found To Be Something Else, He Caused Him To Be Dragged From His Tribunal By Centurions And Soldiers, And Tortured Like A Slave: And Although He Made No Confession, Ordered Him To Be Put To Death, After He Had, With His Own Hands, Plucked Out His Eyes. His Own Account Of The Matter, However, Is, That Quintus Gallius Sought A Private Conference With Him, For The Purpose Of Assassinating Him; That He Therefore Put Him In Prison, But Afterwards Released Him, And Banished Him The City; When He Perished Either In A Storm At Sea, Or By Falling Into The Hands Of Robbers.</h4></div> </div>
