<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xv. In The Eighth Month Of His Reign, The Troops Both In Moesia And Pannonia Revolted From Him; As Did Likewise, Of The Armies Beyond Sea, Those In Judaea And Syria, Some Of Which Swore Allegiance To Vespasian As Emperor In His Own Presence, And Others In His Absence. In Order, Therefore, To Secure The Favour And Affection Of The People, Vitellius Lavished On All Around Whatever He Had It In His Power To Bestow, Both Publicly And Privately, In The Most Extravagant Manner. He Also Levied Soldiers In The City, And Promised All Who Enlisted As Volunteers, Not Only Their Discharge After The Victory Was Gained, But All The Rewards Due To Veterans Who Had Served Their Full Time In The Wars. The Enemy Now Pressing Forward Both By Sea And Land, On One Hand He Opposed Against Them His Brother With A Fleet, The New Levies, And A Body Of Gladiators, And In Another Quarter The Troops And Generals Who Were Engaged At Bedriacum. But Being Beaten Or Betrayed In Every Direction, He Agreed With Flavius Sabinus, Vespasian’s Brother, To Abdicate, On Condition Of Having His Life Spared, And A Hundred Millions Of Sesterces Granted Him; And He Immediately, Upon The Palace-steps, Publicly Declared To A Large Body Of Soldiers There Assembled, “That He Resigned The Government, Which He Had Accepted Reluctantly;” But They All Remonstrating Against It, He Deferred The Conclusion Of The Treaty. Next Day, Early In The Morning, He Came Down To The Forum In A Very Mean Habit, And With Many Tears Repeated The  Declaration From A Writing Which He Held In His Hand; But The Soldiers And People Again Interposing, And Encouraging Him Not To Give Way, But To Rely On Their Zealous Support, He Recovered His Courage, And Forced Sabinus, With The Rest Of The Flavian Party, Who Now Thought Themselves Secure, To Retreat Into The Capitol, Where He Destroyed Them All By Setting Fire To The Temple Of Jupiter, Whilst He Beheld The Contest And The Fire From Tiberius’s House , Where He Was Feasting. Not Long After, Repenting Of What He Had Done, And Throwing The Blame Of It Upon Others, He Called A Meeting, And Swore “That Nothing Was Dearer To Him Than The Public Peace;” Which Oath He Also Obliged The Rest To Take. Then Drawing A Dagger From His Side, He Presented It First To The Consul, And, Upon His Refusing It, To The Magistrates, And Then To Every One Of The Senators; But None Of Them Being Willing To Accept It, He Went Away, As If He Meant To Lay It Up In The Temple Of Concord; But Some Crying Out To Him, “You Are Concord,” He Came Back Again, And Said That He Would Not Only Keep His Weapon, But For The Future Use The Cognomen Of Concord.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
