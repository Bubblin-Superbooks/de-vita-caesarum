“Lydia,” a work to men of learning dear.</p><p>Cinna  thus notices the “Diana.”</p><p>Secula permaneat nostri Diana Catonis.
Immortal be our Cato’s song of Dian.</p><p>He lived to extreme old age, but in the lowest state of penury, and almost in actual want; having retired to a small cottage when he gave up his Tusculan villa to his creditors; as Bibaculus tells us:</p><p>Si quis forte mei domum Catonis,
Depictas minio assulas, et illos
Custodis vidit hortulos Priapi,
Miratur, quibus ille disciplinis,
Tantam sit sapientiam assecutus,
Quam tres cauliculi et selibra farris;
Racemi duo, tegula sub una,
Ad summam prope nutriant senectam.</p></div> </div>
