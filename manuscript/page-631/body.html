In Correcting The Roll Of Judges, He Struck Off The Name Of One Who, Concealing The Privilege His Children Gave Him To Be Excused From Serving, Had Answered To His Name, As Too Eager For The Office. Another Who Was Summoned Before Him In A Cause Of His Own, But Alleged That The Affair Did Not Properly Come Under The  Call Him Back, As He Was Quitting The Tribunal, But Would Seize Him By The Lap Of His Coat, And Sometimes Catch Him By The Heels, To Make Him Stay.
