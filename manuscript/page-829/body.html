<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Ii. The Emperor Otho Was Born Upon The Fourth Of The Calends Of May [28Th April], In The Consulship Of Camillus Aruntius And Domitius Aenobarbus . He Was From His Earliest Youth So Riotous And Wild, That He Was Often Severely Scourged By His Father. He Was Said To Run About In The Night-time, And Seize Upon Any One He Met, Who Was Either Drunk Or Too Feeble To Make Resistance, And Toss Him In A Blanket . After His Father’s Death, To Make His Court The More Effectually To A Freedwoman About The Palace, Who Was In Great Favour, He Pretended To Be In Love With Her, Though She Was Old, And Almost Decrepit. Having By Her Means Got Into Nero’s Good Graces, He Soon Became One Of The Principal Favourites, By The Congeniality Of His Disposition To That Of The Emperor Or, As Some Say, By The Reciprocal Practice Of Mutual Pollution. He Had So Great A Sway At Court, That When A Man Of Consular Rank Was Condemned For Bribery, Having Tampered With Him For A Large Sum Of Money, To Procure His Pardon; Before He Had Quite Effected It, He Scrupled Not To Introduce Him Into The Senate, To Return His Thanks.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
