For, Not To Enumerate How Many And What Persons Of The Adverse Party He Pardoned, Received Into Favour, And Suffered To Rise To The Highest Eminence In The State; He Thought It Sufficient To Punish Junius Novatus And Cassius Patavinus, Who Were Both Plebeians, One Of Them With A Fine, And The Other With An Easy Banishment; Although The Former Had Published, In The Name Of Young Agrippa, A Very Scurrilous Letter Against Him, And The Other Declared Openly, At An Entertainment Where There Was A Great Deal Of Company, “That He Neither Wanted Inclination Nor Courage To Stab Him.” In The Trial Of Aemilius Aelianus, Of Cordova, When, Among Other Charges Exhibited Against Him, It Was Particularly Insisted Upon, That He Used To Calumniate Caesar, He Turned Round To The Accuser, And Said, With An Air And Tone Of Passion, “I Wish You Could Make That Appear; I Shall Let Aelianus Know That I Have A Tongue Too, And Shall Speak Sharper Of Him Than He Ever Did Of Me.” Nor Did He, Either Then Or Afterwards, Make Any Farther Inquiry Into The Affair. And When Tiberius, In A Letter, Complained Of The Affront With Great Earnestness, He Returned Him An Answer In The Following Terms: “Do Not, My Dear Tiberius, Give Way To The Ardour Of Youth In This Affair; Nor Be So Indignant That Any Person Should Speak Ill Of Me. It Is Enough, For Us, If We Can Prevent Any One From Really Doing Us Mischief.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
