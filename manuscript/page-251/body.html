He Advanced Many Of His Freedmen To Posts Of Honour And Great Importance, As Licinus, Enceladus, And Others; And When His Slave, Cosmus, Had Reflected Bitterly Upon Him, He Resented The Injury No Further Than By Putting Him In Fetters. When His Steward, Diomedes, Left Him To The Mercy Of A Wild Boar, Which Suddenly Attacked Them While They Were Walking Together, He Considered It Rather A Cowardice Than A Breach Of Duty; And Turned An Occurrence Of No Small Hazard Into A Jest, Because There Was No Knavery In His Steward’s Conduct. He Put To Death Proculus, One Of His Most Favourite Freedmen, For Maintaining A Criminal Commerce With Other Men’s Wives. He Broke The Legs Of His Secretary, Thallus, For Taking A Bribe Of Five Hundred Denarii To Discover The Contents Of One Of His Letters. And The Tutor And Other Attendants Of His Son Caius, Having Taken Advantage Of His Sickness And Death, To Give Loose To Their Insolence And Rapacity In The Province He Governed, He Caused Heavy Weights To Be Tied About Their Necks, And Had Them Thrown Into A River.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
