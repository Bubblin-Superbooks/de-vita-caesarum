About This Time, Epidius  Having Fallen Into Disgrace For Bringing A False Accusation, Opened A School Of Instruction, In Which He Taught, Among Others, Mark Antony And Augustus. On One Occasion Caius Canutius Jeered Them For Presuming To Belong To The Party Of The Consul Isauricus  In His Administration Of The Republic; Upon Which He Replied, That He Would Rather Be The Disciple Of Isauricus, Than Of Epidius, The False Accuser. This Epidius Claimed To Be Descended From Epidius Nuncio, Who, As  Ancient Traditions Assert, Fell Into The Fountain Of The River Sarnus  When The Streams Were Overflown, And Not Being Afterwards Found, Was Reckoned Among The Number Of The Gods.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
