Upon His Last Birth-day, He Had Brought A Full-sized Statue Of The Timenian Apollo From Syracuse, A Work Of Exquisite Art, Intending To Place It In The Library Of The New Temple ; But He Dreamt That The God Appeared To Him In The Night, And Assured Him “That His Statue Could Not Be Erected By Him.” A Few Days Before He Died, The Pharos At Capri Was Thrown Down By An Earthquake.
