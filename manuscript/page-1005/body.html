He Himself Tells Us, In His Little Work Called “Indignatio,” That He Was Born Free, And Being Left An Orphan, Was Exposed To Be Easily Stripped Of His Patrimony During The Licence Of Sylla’s Administrations. He Had A Great Number Of Distinguished Pupils, And Was Highly Esteemed As A Preceptor Suited To Those Who Had A Poetical Turn, As Appears From These Short Lines:</h4><p class="  start-chapter">Cato grammaticus, Latina Siren,

To form the poet skilled, and poetry rehearse.</p></div> </div>
