<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Lxxv. Both In His Administration And His Conduct Towards The Vanquished Party In The Civil War, He Showed A Wonderful Moderation And Clemency. For While Pompey Declared That He Would Consider Those As Enemies Who Did Not Take Arms In Defence Of The Republic, He Desired It To Be Understood, That He  Should Regard Those Who Remained Neuter As His Friends. With Regard To All Those To Whom He Had, On Pompey’s Recommendation, Given Any Command In The Army, He Left Them At Perfect Liberty To Go Over To Him, If They Pleased. When Some Proposals Were Made At Ileria  For A Surrender, Which Gave Rise To A Free Communication Between The Two Camps, And Afranius And Petreius, Upon A Sudden Change Of Resolution, Had Put To The Sword All Caesar’s Men Who Were Found In The Camp, He Scorned To Imitate The Base Treachery Which They Had Practised Against Himself. On The Field Of Pharsalia, He Called Out To The Soldiers “To Spare Their Fellow-citizens,” And Afterwards Gave Permission To Every Man In His Army To Save An Enemy. None Of Them, So Far As Appears, Lost Their Lives But In Battle, Excepting Only Afranius, Faustus, And Young Lucius Caesar; And It Is Thought That Even They Were Put To Death Without His Consent. Afranius And Faustus Had Borne Arms Against Him, After Obtaining Their Pardon; And Lucius Caesar Had Not Only In The Most Cruel Manner Destroyed With Fire And Sword His Freed-men And Slaves, But Cut To Pieces The Wild Beasts Which He Had Prepared For The Entertainment Of The People. And Finally, A Little Before His Death, He Permitted All Whom He Had Not Before Pardoned, To Return Into Italy, And To Bear Offices Both Civil And Military. He Even Replaced The Statues Of Sylla And Pompey, Which Had Been Thrown Down By The Populace. And After This, Whatever Was Devised Or Uttered, He Chose Rather To Check Than To Punish It. Accordingly, Having Detected Certain Conspiracies And Nocturnal Assemblies, He Went No Farther Than To Intimate By A Proclamation That He Knew Of Them; And As To Those Who Indulged Themselves In The Liberty Of Reflecting Severely Upon Him, He Only Warned Them In A Public Speech Not To Persist In Their Offence. He Bore With Great Moderation A Virulent Libel Written Against Him By Aulus Caecinna, And The Abusive Lampoons Of Pitholaus, Most Highly Reflecting On His Reputation.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
