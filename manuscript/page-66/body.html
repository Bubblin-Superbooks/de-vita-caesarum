His Thoughts Were Now Fully Employed From Day To Day On A Variety Of Great Projects For The Embellishment And Improvement Of The City, As Well As For Guarding And Extending The Bounds Of The Empire. In The First Place, He Meditated The Construction Of A Temple To Mars, Which Should Exceed In Grandeur Every Thing Of That Kind In The World. For This Purpose, He Intended To Fill Up The Lake On Which He Had Entertained The People With The Spectacle Of A Sea-fight. He Also Projected A Most Spacious Theatre Adjacent To The Tarpeian Mount; And Also Proposed To Reduce The Civil Law To A Reasonable Compass, And Out Of That Immense And Undigested Mass Of Statutes To Extract The Best And Most Necessary Parts Into A Few Books; To Make As Large A Collection As Possible Of Works In The Greek And Latin Languages, For The Public Use; The Province Of Providing And Putting Them In Proper Order Being Assigned To Marcus Varro. He Intended Likewise To Drain The Pomptine Marshes, To Cut A Channel For The Discharge Of The Waters Of The Lake Fucinus, To Form A Road From The Upper Sea Through The Ridge Of The Appenine To The Tiber; To Make A Cut Through The Isthmus Of Corinth, To Reduce The Dacians, Who Had Over-run Pontus And Thrace, Within Their Proper Limits, And Then To Make War Upon The Parthians, Through The Lesser Armenia, But Not To Risk A General Engagement With Them, Until He Had Made Some Trial Of Their Prowess In War. But In The Midst Of All His Undertakings And Projects, He Was Carried Off By Death; Before I Speak Of Which, It May Not Be Improper To Give An Account Of His Person, Dress, And Manners; Together With What Relates To His Pursuits, Both Civil And Military.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
