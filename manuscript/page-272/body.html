<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Lxxxv. He Composed Many Tracts In Prose On Various Subjects, Some Of Which He Read Occasionally In The Circle Of His Friends, As To An Auditory. Among These Was His “Rescript To Brutus Respecting Cato.” Most Of The Pages He Read Himself, Although He Was Advanced In Years, But Becoming Fatigued, He Gave The Rest To Tiberius To Finish. He Likewise Read Over To  His Friends His “Exhortations To Philosophy,” And The “History Of His Own Life,” Which He Continued In Thirteen Books, As Far As The Cantabrian War, But No Farther. He Likewise Made Some Attempts At Poetry. There Is Extant One Book Written By Him In Hexameter Verse, Of Which Both The Subject And Title Is “Sicily.” There Is Also A Book Of Epigrams, No Larger Than The Last, Which He Composed Almost Entirely While He Was In The Bath. These Are All His Poetical Compositions For Though He Begun A Tragedy With Great Zest, Becoming Dissatisfied With The Style, He Obliterated The Whole; And His Friends Saying To Him, “What Is Your Ajax Doing?” He Answered, “My Ajax Has Met With A Sponge.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
