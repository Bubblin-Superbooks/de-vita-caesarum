He Was Unwilling To Be Thought Or Called The Grandson Of Agrippa, Because Of The Obscurity Of His Birth; And He Was Offended If Any One, Either In Prose Or Verse, Ranked Him Amongst The Caesars. He Said That His Mother Was The Fruit Of An Incestuous Commerce, Maintained By Augustus With His Daughter Julia. And Not Content With This Vile Reflection Upon The Memory Of Augustus, He Forbad His Victories At Actium, And On The Coast Of Sicily, To Be Celebrated, As Usual; Affirming That They Had Been Most Pernicious And Fatal To The Roman People. He Called His Grandmother Livia Augusta “Ulysses In A Woman’s Dress,” And Had The Indecency To Reflect Upon Her In A Letter To The Senate, As Of Mean Birth, And Descended, By The Mother’s Side, From A Grandfather Who Was Only One Of The Municipal Magistrates Of Fondi; Whereas It Is Certain, From The Public Records, That Aufidius Lurco Held High Offices At Rome. His Grandmother Antonia Desiring A Private Conference With Him, He Refused To Grant It, Unless Macro, The Prefect Of The Pretorian Guards, Were Present. Indignities Of This Kind, And Ill Usage, Were The Cause Of Her Death; But Some Think He Also Gave Her Poison. Nor Did He Pay The Smallest Respect To Her Memory After Her Death, But Witnessed The Burning From His Private Apartment. His Brother Tiberius, Who Had No Expectation Of Any Violence, Was Suddenly Dispatched By A Military Tribune Sent By His Order For That Purpose. He Forced Silanus, His Father-in-law, To Kill Himself, By Cutting His Throat With A Razor. The Pretext He Alleged For These Murders Was, That The Latter Had Not Followed Him Upon His Putting To Sea In Stormy Weather, But Stayed Behind With The View Of Seizing The City, If He Should Perish. The Other, He Said, Smelt Of An Antidote, Which He Had Taken To Prevent His Being Poisoned By Him; Whereas Silanus Was Only Afraid Of Being Sea-sick, And The Disagreeableness Of A Voyage; And Tiberius Had Merely Taken A Medicine For An Habitual Cough,  Which Was Continually Growing Worse. As For His Successor Claudius, He Only Saved Him For A Laughing-stock.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
