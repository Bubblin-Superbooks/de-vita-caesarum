In The War Of Modena, Notwithstanding The Weighty Affairs In Which He Was Engaged, He Is Said To Have Read, Written, And Declaimed Every Day. He Never Addressed The Senate, The People, Or The Army, But In A Premeditated Speech, Though He Did Not Want The Talent Of Speaking Extempore On The Spur Of The Occasion. And Lest His Memory Should Fail Him, As Well As To Prevent The Loss Of Time In Getting Up His Speeches, It Was His General Practice To Recite Them. In His Intercourse With Individuals, And Even With His Wife Livia, Upon Subjects Of Importance He Wrote On His Tablets All He Wished To Express, Lest, If He Spoke Extempore, He Should Say More Or Less Than Was Proper. He Delivered Himself In A Sweet And Peculiar Tone, In Which He Was Diligently Instructed By A Master Of Elocution. But When He Had A Cold, He Sometimes Employed A Herald To Deliver His Speeches To The People.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
