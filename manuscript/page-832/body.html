As Soon As An Opportunity Of Revenge Offered, He Readily Joined In Galbaâ€™s Enterprises, And At The Same Time Conceived Hopes Of Obtaining The Imperial Dignity For Himself. To This He Was Much Encouraged By The State Of The Times, But Still More By The Assurances Given Him By Seleucus, The Astrologer, Who, Having Formerly Told Him That He Would Certainly Out-live Nero, Came To Him At That Juncture Unexpectedly, Promising Him Again That He Should Succeed To The Empire, And That In A Very Short Time. He, Therefore, Let Slip No Opportunity Of Making His Court To Every One About Him By All Manner Of Civilities. As Often As He Entertained Galba At Supper, He Distributed To Every Man Of The Cohort Which Attended The Emperor On Guard, A Gold Piece; Endeavouring Likewise To Oblige The Rest Of The Soldiers In One Way Or Another. Being Chosen An Arbitrator By One Who Had A Dispute With His Neighbour About A Piece Of Land, He Bought It, And Gave It Him; So That Now Almost Every Body Thought And Said, That He Was The Only Man Worthy Of Succeeding To The Empire.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
