<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Xv. Caligula Himself Inflamed This Devotion, By Practising All The Arts Of Popularity. After He Had Delivered, With Floods Of Tears, A Speech In Praise Of Tiberius, And Buried Him With The Utmost Pomp, He Immediately Hastened Over To Pandataria And The Pontian Islands , To Bring Thence The Ashes Of His Mother And Brother; And, To Testify The Great Regard He Had For Their Memory, He Performed The Voyage In A Very Tempestuous Season. He Approached Their Remains With Profound Veneration, And Deposited Them In The Urns With His Own Hands. Having Brought Them In Grand Solemnity To Ostia , With An Ensign Flying In The Stern Of The Galley, And Thence Up The Tiber To Rome, They Were Borne By Persons Of The First Distinction In The Equestrian Order, On Two Biers, Into The Mausoleum ,  At Noon-day. He Appointed Yearly Offerings To Be Solemnly And Publicly Celebrated To Their Memory, Besides Circensian Games To That Of His Mother, And A Chariot With Her Image To Be Included In The Procession . The Month Of September He Called Germanicus, In Honour Of His Father. By A Single Decree Of The Senate, He Heaped Upon His Grandmother, Antonia, All The Honours Which Had Been Ever Conferred On The Empress Livia. His Uncle, Claudius, Who Till Then Continued In The Equestrian Order, He Took For His Colleague In The Consulship. He Adopted His Brother, Tiberius , On The Day He Took Upon Him The Manly Habit, And Conferred Upon Him The Title Of “Prince Of The Youths.” As For His Sisters, He Ordered These Words To Be Added To The Oaths Of Allegiance To Himself: “Nor Will I Hold Myself Or My Own Children More Dear Than I Do Caius And His Sisters:”  And Commanded All Resolutions Proposed By The Consuls In The Senate To Be Prefaced Thus: “May What We Are Going To Do, Prove Fortunate And Happy To Caius Caesar And His Sisters.” With The Like Popularity He Restored All Those Who Had Been Condemned And Banished, And Granted An Act Of Indemnity Against All Impeachments And Past Offences. To Relieve The Informers And Witnesses Against His Mother And Brothers From All Apprehension, He Brought The Records Of Their Trials Into The Forum, And There Burnt Them, Calling Loudly On The Gods To Witness That He Had Not Read Or Handled Them. A Memorial Which Was Offered Him Relative To His Own Security, He Would Not Receive, Declaring, “That He Had Done Nothing To Make Any One His Enemy:” And Said, At The Same Time, “He Had No Ears For Informers.”</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
