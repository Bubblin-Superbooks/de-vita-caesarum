These Taxes Being Imposed, But The Act By Which They Were Levied Never Submitted To Public Inspection, Great Grievances Were Experienced From The Want Of Sufficient Knowledge Of The Law. At Length, On The Urgent Demands Of The Roman People, He Published The Law, But It Was Written In A Very Small Hand, And Posted Up In A Corner, So That No One Could Make A Copy Of It. To Leave No Sort Of Gain Untried, He Opened Brothels In The Palatium, With A Number Of Cells, Furnished Suitably To The Dignity Of The Place; In Which Married Women And Free-born Youths Were Ready For The Reception Of Visitors. He Sent Likewise His Nomenclators About The Forums And Courts, To Invite People Of All Ages, The Old As Well As The Young, To His Brothel, To Come And Satisfy Their Lusts; And He Was Ready To Lend His Customers Money Upon Interest; Clerks Attending To Take Down Their Names In Public, As Persons Who Contributed To The Emperorâ€™s Revenue. Another Method Of Raising Money, Which He Thought Not Below His Notice, Was Gaming; Which, By The Help Of Lying And Perjury, He Turned To Considerable Account. Leaving Once The Management Of His Play To His Partner In The Game, He Stepped Into The Court, And Observing Two Rich Roman Knights Passing By, He Ordered Them Immediately To Be Seized, And Their Estates Confiscated. Then Returning, In Great Glee, He Boasted That He Had Never Made A Better Throw In His Life.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
