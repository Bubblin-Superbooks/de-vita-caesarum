<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Lv. In Eloquence And Warlike Achievements, He Equalled At Least, If He Did Not Surpass, The Greatest Of Men. After His Prosecution Of Dolabella, He Was Indisputably Reckoned One Of The Most Distinguished Advocates. Cicero, In Recounting To Brutus The Famous Orators, Declares, “That He Does Not See That Caesar Was Inferior To Any One Of Them;” And Says, “That He  Had An Elegant, Splendid, Noble, And Magnificent Vein Of Eloquence.” And In A Letter To Cornelius Nepos, He Writes Of Him In The Following Terms: “What! Of All The Orators, Who, During The Whole Course Of Their Lives, Have Done Nothing Else, Which Can You Prefer To Him? Which Of Them Is More Pointed Or Terse In His Periods, Or Employs More Polished And Elegant Language?” In His Youth, He Seems To Have Chosen Strabo Caesar For His Model; From Whose Oration In Behalf Of The Sardinians He Has Transcribed Some Passages Literally Into His Divination. In His Delivery He Is Said To Have Had A Shrill Voice, And His Action Was Animated, But Not Ungraceful. He Has Left Behind Him Some Speeches, Among Which Are Ranked A Few That Are Not Genuine, Such As That On Behalf Of Quintus Metellus. These Augustus Supposes, With Reason, To Be Rather The Production Of Blundering Short-hand Writers, Who Were Not Able To Keep Pace With Him In The Delivery, Than Publications Of His Own. For I Find In Some Copies That The Title Is Not “For Metellus,” But “What He Wrote To Metellus;” Whereas The Speech Is Delivered In The Name Of Caesar, Vindicating Metellus And Himself From The Aspersions Cast Upon Them By Their Common Defamers. The Speech Addressed “To His Soldiers In Spain,” Augustus Considers Likewise As Spurious. We Meet With Two Under This Title; One Made, As Is Pretended, In The First Battle, And The Other In The Last; At Which Time, Asinius Pollio Says, He Had Not Leisure To Address The Soldiers, On Account Of The Suddenness Of The Enemy’s Attack.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
