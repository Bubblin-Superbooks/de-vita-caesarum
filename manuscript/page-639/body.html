The Courts Of Judicature, Whose Sittings Had Been Formerly Divided Between The Summer And Winter Months, He Ordered, For The Dispatch Of Business, To Sit The Whole Year Round. The Jurisdiction In Matters Of Trust, Which Used To Be Granted Annually By Special Commission To Certain Magistrates, And In The City Only, He Made Permanent, And Extended To The Provincial Judges Likewise. He Altered A Clause Added By Tiberius To The Papia-poppaean Law , Which Inferred That Men Of Sixty Years Of Age Were Incapable Of Begetting Children. He Ordered That, Out Of The Ordinary Course Of Proceeding, Orphans Might Have Guardians Appointed Them By The Consuls; And That Those Who Were Banished From Any Province By The Chief Magistrate, Should Be Debarred From Coming Into The City, Or Any Part Of Italy. He Inflicted On Certain Persons A New Sort Of Banishment, By Forbidding Them To Depart Further Than Three Miles From Rome. When Any Affair Of Importance Came Before The Senate, He Used To Sit Between The Two Consuls Upon The Seats Of The Tribunes. He Reserved To Himself The Power Of Granting License To Travel Out Of Italy, Which Before Had Belonged To The Senate.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
