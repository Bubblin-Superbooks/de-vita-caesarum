On Arriving At The Camp, In Order To Show Himself An Active General, And Severe Disciplinarian, He Cashiered The Lieutenants Who Came Up Late With The Auxiliary Forces From Different Quarters. In Reviewing The Army, He Deprived Of Their Companies Most Of The Centurions Of The First Rank, Who Had Now Served Their Legal Time In The Wars, And Some Whose Time Would Have Expired In A Few Days; Alleging Against Them Their Age And Infirmity; And Railing At The Covetous Disposition  Of The Rest Of Them, He Reduced The Bounty Due To Those Who Had Served Out Their Time To The Sum Of Six Thousand Sesterces. Though He Only Received The Submission Of Adminius, The Son Of Cunobeline, A British King, Who Being Driven From His Native Country By His Father, Came Over To Him With A Small Body Of Troops , Yet, As If The Whole Island Had Been Surrendered To Him, He Dispatched Magnificent Letters To Rome, Ordering The Bearers To Proceed In Their Carriages Directly Up To The Forum And The Senate-house, And Not To Deliver The Letters But To The Consuls In The Temple Of Mars, And In The Presence Of A Full Assembly Of The Senators.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
