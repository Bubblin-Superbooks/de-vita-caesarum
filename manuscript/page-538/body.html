It Is Generally Agreed, That Germanicus Possessed All The Noblest Endowments Of Body And Mind In A Higher Degree Than Had Ever Before Fallen To The Lot Of Any Man; A Handsome Person, Extraordinary Courage, Great Proficiency In Eloquence And Other Branches Of Learning, Both Greek And Roman; Besides A Singular Humanity, And A Behaviour So Engaging, As To Captivate The Affections Of All About Him. The Slenderness Of His Legs Did Not Correspond With The Symmetry And Beauty Of His Person In Other Respects; But This Defect Was At Length Corrected By His Habit Of Riding After Meals. In Battle, He Often Engaged And Slew An Enemy In Single Combat. He Pleaded Causes, Even After He Had The Honour Of A Triumph. Among Other Fruits Of His Studies, He Left Behind Him Some Greek Comedies. Both At Home And Abroad He Always Conducted Himself In A Manner The Most Unassuming. On Entering Any Free And Confederate Town, He Never Would Be Attended By His Lictors. Whenever He Heard, In His Travels, Of The Tombs Of Illustrious Men, He Made Offerings Over Them To The Infernal Deities. He Gave A Common Grave, Under A Mound Of Earth, To The Scattered Relics Of The Legionaries Slain Under Varus, And Was The First To Put His Hand To The Work Of Collecting And Bringing Them To The Place Of Burial. He Was So Extremely Mild And Gentle To His Enemies, Whoever They Were, Or On What Account Soever They Bore Him Enmity, That, Although Piso Rescinded His Decrees, And For A Long Time Severely Harassed His Dependents, He Never Showed The Smallest Resentment, Until He Found Himself Attacked By Magical Charms And Imprecations; And Even Then The Only Steps He Took Was To Renounce All Friendship With Him, According To Ancient Custom, And To Exhort His Servants To Avenge His Death, If Any Thing Untoward Should Befall Him.</h4><hr class="section"></div> </div>
