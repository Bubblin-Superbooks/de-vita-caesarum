Julius Caesar, The Divine , Lost His Father  When He Was In The Sixteenth Year Of His Age ; And The Year Following, Being Nominated To The Office Of High-priest Of Jupiter , He Repudiated Cossutia, Who Was Very Wealthy, Although Her Family Belonged Only To The Equestrian Order, And To Whom He Had Been Contracted When He Was A Mere Boy. He Then Married  Cornelia, The Daughter Of Cinna, Who Was Four Times Consul; And Had By Her, Shortly Afterwards, A Daughter Named Julia. Resisting All The Efforts Of The Dictator Sylla To Induce Him To Divorce Cornelia, He Suffered The Penalty Of Being Stripped Of His Sacerdotal Office, His Wife’s Dowry, And His Own Patrimonial Estates; And, Being Identified With The Adverse Faction , Was Compelled To Withdraw From Rome. After Changing His Place Of Concealment Nearly Every Night , Although He Was Suffering From A Quartan Ague, And Having Effected His Release By Bribing The Officers Who Had Tracked His Footsteps, He At Length Obtained A Pardon Through The Intercession Of The Vestal Virgins, And Of Mamercus Aemilius And Aurelius Cotta, His Near Relatives. We Are Assured That When Sylla, Having Withstood For A While The Entreaties Of His Own Best Friends, Persons Of Distinguished Rank, At Last Yielded To Their Importunity, He Exclaimed—either By A Divine Impulse, Or From A Shrewd Conjecture: “Your Suit Is Granted, And You May Take Him Among You; But Know,” He Added, “That This Man, For Whose Safety You Are So Extremely Anxious, Will, Some Day Or Other, Be The Ruin Of The Party Of The Nobles, In Defence Of Which You Are Leagued With Me; For In This One Caesar, You Will Find Many A Marius.”</a> <span class="flex">17</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="18">Ii. His First Campaign Was Served In Asia, On The Staff Of The Praetor, M. Thermus; And Being Dispatched Into Bithynia , To Bring Thence A Fleet, He Loitered So Long At The Court Of Nicomedes, As To Give Occasion To Reports Of A Criminal Intercourse Between Him And That Prince; Which Received Additional Credit From His Hasty Return To Bithynia, Under The Pretext Of Recovering A Debt Due To A Freed-man, His Client. The Rest Of His Service Was More Favourable To His Reputation; And  When Mitylene  Was Taken By Storm, He Was Presented By Thermus With The Civic Crown.</a> <span class="flex">18</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="19">Iii. He Served Also In Cilicia , Under Servilius Isauricus, But Only For A Short Time; As Upon Receiving Intelligence Of Sylla’s Death, He Returned With All Speed To Rome, In Expectation Of What Might Follow From A Fresh Agitation Set On Foot By Marcus Lepidus. Distrusting, However, The Abilities Of This Leader, And Finding The Times Less Favourable For The Execution Of This Project Than He Had At First Imagined, He Abandoned All Thoughts Of Joining Lepidus, Although He Received The Most Tempting Offers.</a> <span class="flex">19</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="20">Iv. Soon After This Civil Discord Was Composed, He Preferred A Charge Of Extortion Against Cornelius Dolabella, A Man Of Consular Dignity, Who Had Obtained The Honour Of A Triumph. On The Acquittal Of The Accused, He Resolved To Retire To Rhodes , With The View Not Only Of Avoiding The Public Odium  Which He Had Incurred, But Of Prosecuting His Studies With Leisure And Tranquillity, Under Apollonius, The Son Of Molon, At That Time The Most Celebrated Master Of Rhetoric. While On His Voyage Thither, In The Winter Season, He Was Taken By Pirates Near The Island Of Pharmacusa , And Detained By Them, Burning With Indignation, For Nearly Forty Days; His Only Attendants Being A Physician And Two Chamberlains. For He Had Instantly Dispatched His Other Servants And The Friends Who Accompanied Him, To Raise Money For His Ransom . Fifty Talents Having Been Paid Down, He Was Landed On The Coast, When, Having Collected Some Ships , He Lost No Time In Putting To Sea In Pursuit Of The Pirates, And Having Captured Them, Inflicted Upon Them The Punishment With Which He Had Often Threatened Them In Jest. At That Time Mithridates Was Ravaging The Neighbouring Districts, And On Caesar’s Arrival At Rhodes, That He Might Not Appear To Lie Idle While Danger Threatened The Allies Of Rome, He Passed Over Into Asia, And Having Collected Some Auxiliary Forces, And Driven The King’s Governor Out Of The Province, Retained In Their Allegiance The Cities Which Were Wavering, And Ready To Revolt.</a> <span class="flex">20</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="21">V. Having Been Elected Military Tribune, The First Honour He Received From The Suffrages Of The People After His Return To Rome, He Zealously Assisted Those Who Took Measures For Restoring The Tribunitian Authority, Which Had Been Greatly Diminished During The Usurpation Of Sylla. He Likewise, By An Act, Which Plotius At His Suggestion Propounded To The People, Obtained The Recall Of Lucius Cinna, His Wife’s Brother, And Others With Him, Who Having Been The Adherents Of Lepidus In The Civil Disturbances, Had After That Consul’s Death Fled To Sertorius ; Which Law He Supported By A Speech.</a> <span class="flex">21</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="22">Vi. During His Quaestorship He Pronounced Funeral Orations From The Rostra, According To Custom, In Praise Of His Aunt  Julia, And His Wife Cornelia. In The Panegyric On His Aunt, He Gives The Following Account Of Her Own And His Father’s Genealogy, On Both Sides: “My Aunt Julia Derived Her Descent, By The Mother, From A Race Of Kings, And By Her Father, From The Immortal Gods. For The Marcii Reges , Her Mother’s Family, Deduce Their Pedigree From Ancus Marcius, And The Julii, Her Father’s, From Venus; Of Which Stock We Are A Branch. We Therefore Unite In Our Descent The Sacred Majesty Of Kings, The Chiefest Among Men, And The Divine Majesty Of Gods, To Whom Kings Themselves Are Subject.” To Supply The Place Of Cornelia, He Married Pompeia, The Daughter Of Quintus Pompeius, And Grand-daughter Of Lucius Sylla; But He Afterwards Divorced Her, Upon Suspicion Of Her Having Been Debauched By Publius Clodius. For So Current Was The Report, That Clodius Had Found Access To Her Disguised As A Woman, During The Celebration Of A Religious Solemnity , That The Senate Instituted An Enquiry Respecting The Profanation Of The Sacred Rites.</a> <span class="flex">22</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="23">Vii. Farther-spain  Fell To His Lot As Quaestor; When There, As He Was Going The Circuit Of The Province, By Commission From The Praetor, For The Administration Of Justice, And Had Reached Gades, Seeing A Statue Of Alexander The Great In The Temple Of Hercules, He Sighed Deeply, As If Weary Of His Sluggish Life, For Having Performed No Memorable Actions At An Age  At Which Alexander Had Already Conquered The World. He, Therefore, Immediately Sued For His Discharge, With The View Of Embracing The First Opportunity, Which Might Present Itself In The City, Of Entering Upon A More Exalted Career. In The Stillness Of The Night Following, He Dreamt That He Lay With His Own Mother; But His Confusion Was Relieved, And His Hopes Were Raised To The Highest Pitch, By The Interpreters Of His Dream, Who Expounded It As An Omen That He Should Possess Universal Empire; For  That The Mother Who In His Sleep He Had Found Submissive To His Embraces, Was No Other Than The Earth, The Common Parent Of All Mankind.</a> <span class="flex">23</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="24">Viii. Quitting Therefore The Province Before The Expiration Of The Usual Term, He Betook Himself To The Latin Colonies, Which Were Then Eagerly Agitating The Design Of Obtaining The Freedom Of Rome; And He Would Have Stirred Them Up To Some Bold Attempt, Had Not The Consuls, To Prevent Any Commotion, Detained For Some Time The Legions Which Had Been Raised For Service In Cilicia. But This Did Not Deter Him From Making, Soon Afterwards, A Still Greater Effort Within The Precincts Of The City Itself.</a> <span class="flex">24</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="25">Ix. For, Only A Few Days Before He Entered Upon The Aedileship, He Incurred A Suspicion Of Having Engaged In A Conspiracy With Marcus Crassus, A Man Of Consular Rank; To Whom Were Joined Publius Sylla And Lucius Autronius, Who, After They Had Been Chosen Consuls, Were Convicted Of Bribery. The Plan Of The Conspirators Was To Fall Upon The Senate At The Opening Of The New Year, And Murder As Many Of Them As Should Be Thought Necessary; Upon Which, Crassus Was To Assume The Office Of Dictator, And Appoint Caesar His Master Of The Horse . When The Commonwealth Had Been Thus Ordered According To Their Pleasure, The Consulship Was To Have Been Restored To Sylla And Autronius. Mention Is Made Of This Plot By Tanusius Geminus  In His History, By Marcus Bibulus In His Edicts , And By Curio, The Father, In His Orations . Cicero Likewise Seems To Hint At This In A Letter To Axius, Where He Says, That Caesar  Had In His Consulship Secured To Himself That Arbitrary Power  To Which He Had Aspired When He Was Edile. Tanusius Adds, That Crassus, From Remorse Or Fear, Did Not Appear Upon The Day Appointed For The Massacre Of The Senate; For Which Reason Caesar Omitted To Give The Signal, Which, According To The Plan Concerted Between Them, He Was To Have Made. The Agreement, Curio Says, Was That He Should Shake Off The Toga From His Shoulder. We Have The Authority Of The Same Curio, And Of M. Actorius Naso, For His Having Been Likewise Concerned In Another Conspiracy With Young Cneius Piso; To Whom, Upon A Suspicion Of Some Mischief Being Meditated In The City, The Province Of Spain Was Decreed Out Of The Regular Course . It Is Said To Have Been Agreed Between Them, That Piso Should Head A Revolt In The Provinces, Whilst The Other Should Attempt To Stir Up An Insurrection At Rome, Using As Their Instruments The Lambrani, And The Tribes Beyond The Po. But The Execution Of This Design Was Frustrated In Both Quarters By The Death Of Piso.</a> <span class="flex">25</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="26">X. In His Aedileship, He Not Only Embellished The Comitium, And The Rest Of The Forum , With The Adjoining Halls , But Adorned The Capitol Also, With Temporary Piazzas, Constructed For The Purpose Of Displaying Some Part Of The Superabundant Collections  He Had Made For The Amusement Of The People . He Entertained Them With The Hunting Of Wild Beasts, And With Games, Both Alone And In Conjunction With His Colleague. On This Account, He Obtained The Whole Credit Of The Expense To Which They Had Jointly Contributed; Insomuch That His Colleague, Marcus Bibulus, Could Not Forbear Remarking, That He Was Served In The Manner Of Pollux. For As The Temple  Erected In The Forum To The Two Brothers, Went By The Name Of Castor Alone, So His And Caesar’s Joint Munificence Was Imputed To The Latter Only. To The Other Public Spectacles Exhibited To The People, Caesar Added A Fight Of Gladiators, But With Fewer Pairs Of Combatants Than He Had Intended. For He Had Collected From All Parts So Great A Company Of Them, That His Enemies Became Alarmed; And A Decree Was Made, Restricting The Number Of Gladiators Which Any One Was Allowed To Retain At Rome.</a> <span class="flex">26</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="27">Xi. Having Thus Conciliated Popular Favour, He Endeavoured, Through His Interest With Some Of The Tribunes, To Get Egypt Assigned To Him As A Province, By An Act Of The People. The Pretext Alleged For The Creation Of This Extraordinary Government, Was, That The Alexandrians Had Violently Expelled Their King , Whom The Senate Had Complimented With The Title Of An Ally And Friend Of The Roman People. This Was Generally Resented; But, Notwithstanding, There Was So Much Opposition From The Faction Of The Nobles, That He Could Not Carry His Point. In Order, Therefore, To Diminish Their Influence By Every Means In His Power, He Restored The Trophies Erected In Honour Of Caius Marius, On Account Of His Victories Over Jugurtha, The Cimbri, And The Teutoni, Which Had Been Demolished By Sylla; And When Sitting In Judgment Upon Murderers, He Treated Those As Assassins, Who, In The Late Proscription, Had Received Money From The Treasury, For Bringing In The Heads Of Roman Citizens, Although They Were Expressly Excepted In The Cornelian Laws.</a> <span class="flex">27</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="28">Xii. He Likewise Suborned Some One To Prefer An Impeachment  For Treason Against Caius Rabirius, By Whose Especial Assistance The Senate Had, A Few Years Before, Put Down Lucius Saturninus, The Seditious Tribune; And Being Drawn By Lot A Judge On The Trial, He Condemned Him With So Much Animosity, That Upon His Appealing To The People, No Circumstance Availed Him So Much As The Extraordinary Bitterness Of His Judge.</a> <span class="flex">28</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="29">Xiii. Having Renounced All Hope Of Obtaining Egypt For His Province, He Stood Candidate For The Office Of Chief Pontiff, To Secure Which, He Had Recourse To The Most Profuse Bribery. Calculating, On This Occasion, The Enormous Amount Of The Debts He Had Contracted, He Is Reported To Have Said To His Mother, When She Kissed Him At His Going Out In The Morning To The Assembly Of The People, “I Will Never Return Home Unless I Am Elected Pontiff.” In Effect, He Left So Far Behind Him Two Most Powerful Competitors, Who Were Much His Superiors Both In Age And Rank, That He Had More Votes In Their Own Tribes, Than They Both Had In All The Tribes Together.</a> <span class="flex">29</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="30">Xiv. After He Was Chosen Praetor, The Conspiracy Of Catiline Was Discovered; And While Every Other Member Of The Senate Voted For Inflicting Capital Punishment On The Accomplices In That Crime , He Alone Proposed That The Delinquents Should Be Distributed For Safe Custody Among The Towns Of Italy, Their Property Being Confiscated. He Even Struck Such Terror Into Those Who Were Advocates For Greater Severity, By Representing To Them What Universal Odium Would Be Attached To Their Memories By The Roman People, That Decius Silanus, Consul Elect, Did Not Hesitate To Qualify His Proposal, It Not Being Very Honourable To Change It, By A Lenient Interpretation; As If It Had Been Understood In A Harsher Sense Than He Intended, And Caesar Would Certainly Have Carried His Point, Having Brought Over To His Side A Great Number Of The Senators, Among Whom Was Cicero, The Consul’s Brother, Had Not A Speech By Marcus Cato Infused New Vigour Into The Resolutions Of The Senate. He Persisted, However, In Obstructing The Measure, Until A Body Of The Roman Knights, Who Stood Under Arms As A Guard, Threatened Him With Instant Death, If He Continued His Determined Opposition. They Even Thrust At Him With Their Drawn Swords, So That Those Who Sat Next Him Moved Away;  And A Few Friends, With No Small Difficulty, Protected Him, By Throwing Their Arms Round Him, And Covering Him With Their Togas. At Last, Deterred By This Violence, He Not Only Gave Way, But Absented Himself From The Senate-house During The Remainder Of That Year.</a> <span class="flex">30</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="31">Xv. Upon The First Day Of His Praetorship, He Summoned Quintus Catulus To Render An Account To The People Respecting The Repairs Of The Capitol ; Proposing A Decree For Transferring The Office Of Curator To Another Person . But Being Unable To Withstand The Strong Opposition Made By The Aristocratical Party, Whom He Perceived Quitting, In Great Numbers, Their Attendance Upon The New Consuls , And Fully Resolved To Resist His Proposal, He Dropped The Design.</a> <span class="flex">31</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="32">Xvi. He Afterwards Approved Himself A Most Resolute Supporter Of Caecilius Metullus, Tribune Of The People, Who, In Spite Of All Opposition From His Colleagues, Had Proposed Some Laws Of A Violent Tendency , Until They Were Both Dismissed From Office By A Vote Of The Senate. He Ventured, Notwithstanding, To Retain His Post And Continue In The Administration Of Justice; But Finding That Preparations Were Made To Obstruct Him By Force Of Arms, He Dismissed The Lictors, Threw Off His Gown, And Betook Himself Privately To His Own House, With The Resolution Of Being Quiet, In A Time So Unfavourable To His Interests. He Likewise Pacified The Mob, Which Two Days Afterwards Flocked About Him, And In A Riotous Manner Made A Voluntary Tender Of Their Assistance In The Vindication Of His  Honour. This Happening Contrary To Expectation, The Senate, Who Met In Haste, On Account Of The Tumult, Gave Him Their Thanks By Some Of The Leading Members Of The House, And Sending For Him, After High Commendation Of His Conduct, Cancelled Their Former Vote, And Restored Him To His Office.</a> <span class="flex">32</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="33">Xvii. But He Soon Got Into Fresh Trouble, Being Named Amongst The Accomplices Of Catiline, Both Before Novius Niger The Quaestor, By Lucius Vettius The Informer, And In The Senate By Quintus Curius; To Whom A Reward Had Been Voted, For Having First Discovered The Designs Of The Conspirators. Curius Affirmed That He Had Received His Information From Catiline. Vettius Even Engaged To Produce In Evidence Against Him His Own Hand-writing, Given To Catiline. Caesar, Feeling That This Treatment Was Not To Be Borne, Appealed To Cicero Himself, Whether He Had Not Voluntarily Made A Discovery To Him Of Some Particulars Of The Conspiracy; And So Baulked Curius Of His Expected Reward. He, Therefore, Obliged Vettius To Give Pledges For His Behaviour, Seized His Goods, And After Heavily Fining Him, And Seeing Him Almost Torn In Pieces Before The Rostra, Threw Him Into Prison; To Which He Likewise Sent Novius The Quaestor, For Having Presumed To Take An Information Against A Magistrate Of Superior Authority.</a> <span class="flex">33</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="34">Xviii. At The Expiration Of His Praetorship He Obtained By Lot The Farther-spain , And Pacified His Creditors, Who Were For Detaining Him, By Finding Sureties For His Debts . Contrary, However, To Both Law And Custom, He Took His Departure Before The Usual Equipage And Outfit Were Prepared. It Is Uncertain Whether This Precipitancy Arose From The Apprehension Of An Impeachment, With Which He Was Threatened On The Expiration Of His Former Office, Or From His Anxiety To Lose No Time In Relieving The Allies, Who Implored Him To Come To Their Aid. He Had No  Sooner Established Tranquillity In The Province, Than, Without Waiting For The Arrival Of His Successor, He Returned To Rome, With Equal Haste, To Sue For A Triumph , And The Consulship. The Day Of Election, However, Being Already Fixed By Proclamation, He Could Not Legally Be Admitted A Candidate, Unless He Entered The City As A Private Person . On This Emergency He Solicited A Suspension Of The Laws In His Favour; But Such An Indulgence Being Strongly Opposed, He Found Himself Under The Necessity Of Abandoning All Thoughts Of A Triumph, Lest He Should Be Disappointed Of The Consulship.</a> <span class="flex">34</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="35">Xix. Of The Two Other Competitors For The Consulship, Lucius Luceius And Marcus Bibulus, He Joined With The Former, Upon Condition That Luceius, Being A Man Of Less Interest But Greater Affluence, Should Promise Money To The Electors, In Their Joint Names. Upon Which The Party Of The Nobles, Dreading How Far He Might Carry Matters In That High Office, With A Colleague Disposed To Concur In And Second His Measures, Advised Bibulus To Promise The Voters As Much As The Other; And Most Of Them Contributed Towards The Expense, Cato Himself Admitting That Bribery; Under Such Circumstances, Was For The Public Good . He Was Accordingly Elected Consul Jointly With Bibulus. Actuated Still By The Same Motives, The Prevailing Party Took Care To Assign Provinces Of Small Importance To The New Consuls, Such As The Care Of The Woods And Roads. Caesar, Incensed At This Indignity, Endeavoured By The Most Assiduous And Flattering Attentions To Gain To His Side Cneius Pompey, At That Time Dissatisfied With The Senate For The Backwardness They Shewed To Confirm His Acts, After His Victories Over Mithridates. He Likewise Brought About A Reconciliation Between Pompey And Marcus Crassus, Who Had Been At Variance From  The Time Of Their Joint Consulship, In Which Office They Were Continually Clashing; And He Entered Into An Agreement With Both, That Nothing Should Be Transacted In The Government, Which Was Displeasing To Any Of The Three.</a> <span class="flex">35</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="36">Xx. Having Entered Upon His Office , He Introduced A New Regulation, That The Daily Acts Both Of The Senate And People Should Be Committed To Writing, And Published . He Also Revived An Old Custom, That An Officer  Should Precede Him, And His Lictors Follow Him, On The Alternate Months When The Fasces Were Not Carried Before Him. Upon Preferring A Bill To The People For The Division Of Some Public Lands, He Was Opposed By His Colleague, Whom He Violently Drove Out Of The Forum. Next Day The Insulted Consul Made A Complaint In The Senate Of This Treatment; But Such Was The Consternation, That No One Having The Courage To Bring The Matter Forward Or Move A Censure, Which Had Been Often Done Under Outrages Of Less Importance, He Was So Much Dispirited, That Until The Expiration Of His Office He Never Stirred From Home, And Did Nothing But Issue Edicts To Obstruct His Colleague’s Proceedings. From That Time, Therefore, Caesar Had The Sole Management Of Public Affairs; Insomuch That Some Wags, When They Signed Any Instrument As Witnesses, Did Not Add “In The Consulship Of Caesar And Bibulus,” But, “Of Julius And Caesar;” Putting The Same Person Down Twice, Under His Name And Surname. The Following Verses Likewise Were Currently Repeated On This Occasion:</a> <span class="flex">36</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="40">Xxi. About The Same Time He Married Calpurnia, The Daughter Of Lucius Piso, Who Was To Succeed Him In The Consulship, And Gave His Own Daughter Julia To Cneius Pompey; Rejecting Servilius Caepio, To Whom She Had Been Contracted, And By Whose Means Chiefly He Had But A Little Before Baffled Bibulus. After This New Alliance, He Began, Upon Any Debates In The Senate, To Ask Pompey’s Opinion First, Whereas He Used Before To Give That Distinction To Marcus Crassus; And It Was  Of January.</a> <span class="flex">40</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="41">Xxii. Being, Therefore, Now Supported By The Interest Of His Father-in-law And Son-in-law, Of All The Provinces He Made Choice Of Gaul, As Most Likely To Furnish Him With Matter And Occasion For Triumphs. At First Indeed He Received Only Cisalpine-gaul, With The Addition Of Illyricum, By A Decree Proposed By Vatinius To The People; But Soon Afterwards Obtained From The Senate Gallia-comata  Also, The Senators Being Apprehensive, That If They Should Refuse It Him, That Province, Also, Would Be Granted Him By The People. Elated Now With His Success, He Could Not Refrain From Boasting, A Few Days Afterwards, In A Full Senate-house, That He Had, In Spite Of His Enemies, And To Their Great Mortification, Obtained All He Desired, And That For The Future He Would Make Them, To Their Shame, Submissive To His Pleasure. One Of The Senators Observing, Sarcastically: “That Will Not Be Very Easy For A Woman  To Do,” He Jocosely Replied, “Semiramis Formerly Reigned In Assyria, And The Amazons Possessed Great Part Of Asia.”</a> <span class="flex">41</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="42">Xxiii. When The Term Of His Consulship Had Expired, Upon A Motion Being Made In The Senate By Caius Memmius And Lucius Domitius, The Praetors, Respecting The Transactions Of The Year Past, He Offered To Refer Himself To The House; But  They Declining The Business, After Three Days Spent In Vain Altercation, He Set Out For His Province. Immediately, However, His Quaestor Was Charged With Several Misdemeanors, For The Purpose Of Implicating Caesar Himself. Indeed, An Accusation Was Soon After Preferred Against Him By Lucius Antistius, Tribune Of The People; But By Making An Appeal To The Tribune’s Colleagues, He Succeeded In Having The Prosecution Suspended During His Absence In The Service Of The State. To Secure Himself, Therefore, For The Time To Come, He Was Particularly Careful To Secure The Good-will Of The Magistrates At The Annual Elections, Assisting None Of The Candidates With His Interest, Nor Suffering Any Persons To Be Advanced To Any Office, Who Would Not Positively Undertake To Defend Him In His Absence For Which Purpose He Made No Scruple To Require Of Some Of Them An Oath, And Even A Written Obligation.</a> <span class="flex">42</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="43">Xxiv. But When Lucius Domitius Became A Candidate For The Consulship, And Openly Threatened That, Upon His Being Elected Consul, He Would Effect That Which He Could Not Accomplish When He Was Praetor, And Divest Him Of The Command Of The Armies, He Sent For Crassus And Pompey To Lucca, A City In His Province, And Pressed Them, For The Purpose Of Disappointing Domitius, To Sue Again For The Consulship, And To Continue Him In His Command For Five Years Longer; With Both Which Requisitions They Complied. Presumptuous Now From His Success, He Added, At His Own Private Charge, More Legions To Those Which He Had Received From The Republic; Among The Former Of Which Was One Levied In Transalpine Gaul, And Called By A Gallic Name, Alauda , Which He Trained And Armed In The Roman Fashion, And Afterwards Conferred On It The Freedom Of The City. From This Period He Declined No Occasion Of War, However Unjust And Dangerous; Attacking, Without Any Provocation, As Well The Allies Of Rome As The Barbarous Nations Which Were Its Enemies: Insomuch, That The Senate Passed A Decree For Sending Commissioners To Examine Into The Condition Of Gaul; And Some Members Even Proposed That He Should Be Delivered Up To The Enemy. But So Great Had Been The Success Of His Enterprises, That He Had The Honour Of Obtaining More Days   Of Supplication, And Those More Frequently, Than Had Ever Before Been Decreed To Any Commander.</a> <span class="flex">43</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="44">Xxv. During Nine Years In Which He Held The Government Of The Province, His Achievements Were As Follows: He Reduced All Gaul, Bounded By The Pyrenean Forest, The Alps, Mount Gebenna, And The Two Rivers, The Rhine And The Rhone, And Being About Three Thousand Two Hundred Miles In Compass, Into The Form Of A Province, Excepting Only The Nations In Alliance With The Republic, And Such As Had Merited His Favour; Imposing Upon This New Acquisition An Annual Tribute Of Forty Millions Of Sesterces. He Was The First Of The Romans Who, Crossing The Rhine By A Bridge, Attacked The Germanic Tribes Inhabiting The Country Beyond That River, Whom He Defeated In Several Engagements. He Also Invaded The Britons, A People Formerly Unknown, And Having Vanquished Them, Exacted From Them Contributions And Hostages. Amidst Such A Series Of Successes, He Experienced Thrice Only Any Signal Disaster; Once In Britain, When His Fleet Was Nearly Wrecked In A Storm; In Gaul, At Gergovia, Where One Of His Legions Was Put To The Rout; And In The Territory Of The Germans, His Lieutenants Titurius And Aurunculeius Were Cut Off By An Ambuscade.</a> <span class="flex">44</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="45">Xxvi. During This Period  He Lost His Mother , Whose Death Was Followed By That Of His Daughter , And, Not Long Afterwards, Of His Granddaughter. Meanwhile, The Republic Being In Consternation At The Murder Of Publius Clodius, And The Senate Passing A Vote That Only One Consul, Namely, Cneius Pompeius, Should Be Chosen For The Ensuing Year, He Prevailed With The Tribunes Of The People, Who Intended Joining Him In Nomination With Pompey, To Propose To The People A Bill, Enabling Him, Though Absent, To Become A Candidate For His Second Consulship, When The Term Of His Command Should Be Near Expiring, That He Might Not Be Obliged On That Account To Quit His Province Too Soon, And Before The Conclusion Of The War. Having Attained This Object, Carrying His Views Still Higher, And Animated With The Hopes Of Success, He Omitted No  Opportunity Of Gaining Universal Favour, By Acts Of Liberality And Kindness To Individuals, Both In Public And Private. With Money Raised From The Spoils Of The War, He Began To Construct A New Forum, The Ground-plot Of Which Cost Him Above A Hundred Millions Of Sesterces . He Promised The People A Public Entertainment Of Gladiators, And A Feast In Memory Of His Daughter, Such As No One Before Him Had Ever Given. The More To Raise Their Expectations On This Occasion, Although He Had Agreed With Victuallers Of All Denominations For His Feast, He Made Yet Farther Preparations In Private Houses. He Issued An Order, That The Most Celebrated Gladiators, If At Any Time During The Combat They Incurred The Displeasure Of The Public, Should Be Immediately Carried Off By Force, And Reserved For Some Future Occasion. Young Gladiators He Trained Up, Not In The School, And By The Masters, Of Defence, But In The Houses Of Roman Knights, And Even Senators, Skilled In The Use Of Arms, Earnestly Requesting Them, As Appears From His Letters, To Undertake The Discipline Of Those Novitiates, And To Give Them The Word During Their Exercises. He Doubled The Pay Of The Legions In Perpetuity; Allowing Them Likewise Corn, When It Was In Plenty, Without Any Restriction; And Sometimes Distributing To Every Soldier In His Army A Slave, And A Portion Of Land.</a> <span class="flex">45</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="46">Xxvii. To Maintain His Alliance And Good Understanding With Pompey, He Offered Him In Marriage His Sister’s Grand-daughter Octavia, Who Had Been Married To Caius Marcellus; And Requested For Himself His Daughter, Lately Contracted To Faustus Sylla. Every Person About Him, And A Great Part Likewise Of The Senate, He Secured By Loans Of Money At Low Interest, Or None At All; And To All Others Who Came To Wait Upon Him, Either By Invitation Or Of Their Own Accord, He Made Liberal Presents; Not Neglecting Even The Freed-men And Slaves, Who Were Favourites With Their Masters And Patrons. He Offered Also Singular And Ready Aid To All Who Were Under Prosecution, Or In Debt, And To Prodigal Youths; Excluding From  His Bounty Those Only Who Were So Deeply Plunged In Guilt, Poverty, Or Luxury, That It Was Impossible Effectually To Relieve Them. These, He Openly Declared, Could Derive No Benefit From Any Other Means Than A Civil War.</a> <span class="flex">46</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="47">Xxviii. He Endeavoured With Equal Assiduity To Engage In His Interest Princes And Provinces In Every Part Of The World; Presenting Some With Thousands Of Captives, And Sending To Others The Assistance Of Troops, At Whatever Time And Place They Desired, Without Any Authority From Either The Senate Or People Of Rome. He Likewise Embellished With Magnificent Public Buildings The Most Powerful Cities Not Only Of Italy, Gaul, And Spain, But Of Greece And Asia; Until All People Being Now Astonished, And Speculating On The Obvious Tendency Of These Proceedings, Claudius Marcellus, The Consul, Declaring First By Proclamation, That He Intended To Propose A Measure Of The Utmost Importance To The State, Made A Motion In The Senate That Some Person Should Be Appointed To Succeed Caesar In His Province, Before The Term Of His Command Was Expired; Because The War Being Brought To A Conclusion, Peace Was Restored, And The Victorious Army Ought To Be Disbanded. He Further Moved, That Caesar Being Absent, His Claims To Be A Candidate At The Next Election Of Consuls Should Not Be Admitted, As Pompey Himself Had Afterwards Abrogated That Privilege By A Decree Of The People. The Fact Was, That Pompey, In His Law Relating To The Choice Of Chief Magistrates, Had Forgot To Except Caesar, In The Article In Which He Declared All Such As Were Not Present Incapable Of Being Candidates For Any Office; But Soon Afterwards, When The Law Was Inscribed On Brass, And Deposited In The Treasury, He Corrected His Mistake. Marcellus, Not Content With Depriving Caesar Of His Provinces, And The Privilege Intended Him By Pompey, Likewise Moved The Senate, That The Freedom Of The City Should Be Taken From Those Colonists Whom, By The Vatinian Law, He Had Settled At New Como ; Because It Had Been Conferred Upon Them With Ambitious Views, And By A Stretch Of The Laws.</a> <span class="flex">47</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="50">Xxx. But As The Senate Declined To Interpose In The Business, And His Enemies Declared That They Would Enter Into No Compromise Where The Safety Of The Republic Was At Stake, He Advanced Into Hither-gaul , And, Having Gone The Circuit For The Administration Of Justice, Made A Halt At Ravenna, Resolved To Have Recourse To Arms If The Senate Should Proceed To Extremity Against The Tribunes Of The People Who Had Espoused His Cause. This Was Indeed His Pretext For The Civil War; But It Is Supposed That There Were Other Motives For His Conduct. Cneius Pompey Used Frequently To Say, That He Sought To Throw Every Thing Into Confusion, Because He Was Unable, With All His Private Wealth, To Complete The Works He Had Begun, And Answer, At His Return, The Vast Expectations Which He Had Excited In The People. Others Pretend That He Was Apprehensive Of Being  Called To Account For What He Had Done In His First Consulship, Contrary To The Auspices, Laws, And The Protests Of The Tribunes; Marcus Cato Having Sometimes Declared, And That, Too, With An Oath, That He Would Prefer An Impeachment Against Him, As Soon As He Disbanded His Army. A Report Likewise Prevailed, That If He Returned As A Private Person, He Would, Like Milo, Have To Plead His Cause Before The Judges, Surrounded By Armed Men. This Conjecture Is Rendered Highly Probable By Asinius Pollio, Who Informs Us That Caesar, Upon Viewing The Vanquished And Slaughtered Enemy In The Field Of Pharsalia, Expressed Himself In These Very Words: “This Was Their Intention: I, Caius Caesar, After All The Great Achievements I Had Performed, Must Have Been Condemned, Had I Not Summoned The Army To My Aid!” Some Think, That Having Contracted From Long Habit An Extraordinary Love Of Power, And Having Weighed His Own And His Enemies’ Strength, He Embraced That Occasion Of Usurping The Supreme Power; Which Indeed He Had Coveted From The Time Of His Youth. This Seems To Have Been The Opinion Entertained By Cicero, Who Tells Us, In The Third Book Of His Offices, That Caesar Used To Have Frequently In His Mouth Two Verses Of Euripides, Which He Thus Translates:</a> <span class="flex">50</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="52">Xxxi. When Intelligence, Therefore, Was Received, That The Interposition Of The Tribunes In His Favour Had Been Utterly Rejected, And That They Themselves Had Fled From The City, He Immediately Sent Forward Some Cohorts, But Privately, To Prevent Any Suspicion Of His Design; And, To Keep Up Appearances, Attended At A Public Spectacle, Examined The Model Of A Fencing-school Which He Proposed To Build, And, As Usual, Sat Down To Table With A Numerous Party Of His Friends. But After Sun-set, Mules Being Put To His Carriage From A Neighbouring Mill, He Set Forward On His Journey With All Possible Privacy, And A Small Retinue. The Lights Going Out, He Lost His Way, And  Wandered About A Long Time, Until At Length, By The Help Of A Guide, Whom He Found Towards Day-break, He Proceeded On Foot Through Some Narrow Paths, And Again Reached The Road. Coming Up With His Troops On The Banks Of The Rubicon, Which Was The Boundary Of His Province , He Halted For A While, And, Revolving In His Mind The Importance Of The Step He Was On The Point Of Taking, He Turned To Those About Him, And Said: “We May Still Retreat; But If We Pass This Little Bridge, Nothing Is Left For Us But To Fight It Out In Arms.”</a> <span class="flex">52</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="53">Xxxii. While He Was Thus Hesitating, The Following Incident Occurred. A Person Remarkable For His Noble Mien And Graceful Aspect, Appeared Close At Hand, Sitting And Playing Upon A Pipe. When, Not Only The Shepherds, But A Number Of Soldiers Also Flocked From Their Posts To Listen To Him, And Some Trumpeters Among Them, He Snatched A Trumpet From One Of Them, Ran To The River With It, And Sounding The Advance With A Piercing Blast, Crossed To The Other Side. Upon This, Caesar Exclaimed, “Let Us Go Whither The Omens Of The Gods And The Iniquity Of Our Enemies Call Us. The Die Is Now Cast.”</a> <span class="flex">53</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="54">Xxxiii. Accordingly, Having Marched His Army Over The River, He Shewed Them The Tribunes Of The People, Who, Upon Their Being Driven From The City, Had Come To Meet Him; And, In The Presence Of That Assembly, Called Upon The Troops To Pledge Him Their Fidelity, With Tears In His Eyes, And His Garment Rent From His Bosom. It Has Been Supposed, That Upon This Occasion He Promised To Every Soldier A Knight’s Estate; But That Opinion Is Founded On A Mistake. For When, In His Harangue To Them, He Frequently Held Out A Finger Of His Left Hand, And Declared, That To Recompense Those Who Should Support Him In The Defence Of His Honour, He Would Willingly Part Even With His Ring; The Soldiers At A Distance, Who Could More Easily See Than Hear Him While He Spoke, Formed Their Conception Of What He Said, By The Eye, Not By The Ear; And Accordingly Gave Out, That He Had Promised To Each Of Them The Privilege  Of Wearing The Gold Ring, And An Estate Of Four Hundred Thousand Sesterces.</a> <span class="flex">54</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="55">Xxxiv. Of His Subsequent Proceedings I Shall Give A Cursory Detail, In The Order In Which They Occurred . He Took Possession Of Picenum, Umbria, And Etruria; And Having Obliged Lucius Domitius, Who Had Been Tumultuously Nominated His Successor, And Held Corsinium With A Garrison, To Surrender, And Dismissed Him, He Marched Along The Coast Of The Upper Sea, To Brundusium, To Which Place The Consuls And Pompey Were Fled With The Intention Of Crossing The Sea As Soon As Possible. After Vain Attempts, By All The Obstacles He Could Oppose, To Prevent Their Leaving The Harbour, He Turned His Steps Towards Rome, Where He Appealed To The Senate On The Present State Of Public Affairs; And Then Set Out For Spain, In Which Province Pompey Had A Numerous Army, Under The Command Of Three Lieutenants, Marcus Petreius, Lucius Afranius, And Marcus Varro; Declaring Amongst His Friends, Before He Set Forward, “That He Was Going Against An Army Without A General, And Should Return Thence Against A General Without An Army.” Though His Progress Was Retarded Both By The Siege Of Marseilles, Which Shut Her Gates Against Him, And A Very Great Scarcity Of Corn, Yet In A Short Time He Bore Down All Before Him.</a> <span class="flex">55</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="56">Xxxv. Thence He Returned To Rome, And Crossing The Sea To Macedonia, Blocked Up Pompey During Almost Four Months, Within A Line Of Ramparts Of Prodigious Extent; And At Last Defeated Him In The Battle Of Pharsalia. Pursuing Him In His Flight To Alexandria, Where He Was Informed Of His Murder, He Presently Found Himself Also Engaged, Under All The Disadvantages Of Time And Place, In A Very Dangerous War, With King Ptolemy, Who, He Saw, Had Treacherous Designs Upon His Life. It Was Winter, And He, Within The Walls Of A Well-provided And Subtle Enemy, Was Destitute Of Every Thing, And Wholly Unprepared  For Such A Conflict. He Succeeded, However, In His Enterprise, And Put The Kingdom Of Egypt Into The Hands Of Cleopatra And Her Younger Brother; Being Afraid To Make It A Province, Lest, Under An Aspiring Prefect, It Might Become The Centre Of Revolt. From Alexandria He Went Into Syria, And Thence To Pontus, Induced By Intelligence Which He Had Received Respecting Pharnaces. This Prince, Who Was Son Of The Great Mithridates, Had Seized The Opportunity Which The Distraction Of The Times Offered For Making War Upon His Neighbours, And His Insolence And Fierceness Had Grown With His Success. Caesar, However, Within Five Days After Entering His Country, And Four Hours After Coming In Sight Of Him, Overthrew Him In One Decisive Battle. Upon Which, He Frequently Remarked To Those About Him The Good Fortune Of Pompey, Who Had Obtained His Military Reputation, Chiefly, By Victory Over So Feeble An Enemy. He Afterwards Defeated Scipio And Juba, Who Were Rallying The Remains Of The Party In Africa, And Pompey’s Sons In Spain.</a> <span class="flex">56</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="57">Xxxvi. During The Whole Course Of The Civil War, He Never Once Suffered Any Defeat, Except In The Case Of His Lieutenants; Of Whom Caius Curio Fell In Africa, Caius Antonius Was Made Prisoner In Illyricum, Publius Dolabella Lost A Fleet In The Same Illyricum, And Cneius Domitius Culvinus, An Army In Pontus. In Every Encounter With The Enemy Where He Himself Commanded, He Came Off With Complete Success; Nor Was The Issue Ever Doubtful, Except On Two Occasions: Once At Dyrrachium, When, Being Obliged To Give Ground, And Pompey Not Pursuing His Advantage, He Said That “Pompey Knew Not How To Conquer;” The Other Instance Occurred In His Last Battle In Spain, When, Despairing Of The Event, He Even Had Thoughts Of Killing Himself.</a> <span class="flex">57</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="58">Xxxvii. For The Victories Obtained In The Several Wars, He Triumphed Five Different Times; After The Defeat Of Scipio: Four Times In One Month, Each Triumph Succeeding The Former By An Interval Of A Few Days; And Once Again After The Conquest Of Pompey’s Sons. His First And Most Glorious Triumph Was For The Victories He Gained In Gaul; The Next For That Of Alexandria, The Third For The Reduction Of Pontus, The Fourth For His African Victory, And The Last For That In Spain; And  They All Differed From Each Other In Their Varied Pomp And Pageantry. On The Day Of The Gallic Triumph, As He Was Proceeding Along The Street Called Velabrum, After Narrowly Escaping A Fall From His Chariot By The Breaking Of The Axle-tree, He Ascended The Capitol By Torch-light, Forty Elephants  Carrying Torches On His Right And Left. Amongst The Pageantry Of The Pontic Triumph, A Tablet With This Inscription Was Carried Before Him: I Came, I Saw, I Conquered ; Not Signifying, As Other Mottos On The Like Occasion, What Was Done, So Much As The Dispatch With Which It Was Done.</a> <span class="flex">58</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="59">Xxxviii. To Every Foot-soldier In His Veteran Legions, Besides The Two Thousand Sesterces Paid Him In The Beginning Of The Civil War, He Gave Twenty Thousand More, In The Shape Of Prize-money. He Likewise Allotted Them Lands, But Not In Contiguity, That The Former Owners Might Not Be Entirely Dispossessed. To The People Of Rome, Besides Ten Modii Of Corn, And As Many Pounds Of Oil, He Gave Three Hundred Sesterces A Man, Which He Had Formerly Promised Them, And A Hundred More To Each For The Delay In Fulfilling His Engagement. He Likewise Remitted A Year’s Rent Due To The Treasury, For Such Houses In Rome As Did Not Pay Above Two Thousand Sesterces A Year; And Through The Rest Of Italy, For All Such As Did Not Exceed In Yearly Rent Five Hundred Sesterces. To All This He Added A Public Entertainment, And A Distribution Of Meat, And, After His Spanish Victory , Two Public Dinners. For, Considering The First He Had Given As Too Sparing, And Unsuited To His Profuse Liberality, He, Five Days Afterwards, Added Another, Which Was Most Plentiful.</a> <span class="flex">59</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="60">Xxxix. The Spectacles He Exhibited To The People Were Of Various Kinds; Namely, A Combat Of Gladiators , And Stage-plays In The Several Wards Of The City, And In Different Languages; Likewise Circensian Games , Wrestlers, And The Representation Of A Sea-fight. In The Conflict Of Gladiators Presented In The Forum, Furius Leptinus, A Man Of Praetorian Family, Entered The Lists As A Combatant, As Did Also Quintus Calpenus, Formerly A Senator, And A Pleader Of Causes. The Pyrrhic Dance Was Performed By Some Youths, Who Were Sons To Persons Of The First Distinction In Asia And Bithynia. In The Plays, Decimus Laberius, Who Had Been A Roman Knight, Acted In His Own Piece; And Being Presented On The Spot With Five Hundred Thousand Sesterces, And A Gold Ring, He Went From The Stage, Through The Orchestra, And Resumed His Place In The Seats  Allotted For The Equestrian Order. In The Circensisn Games; The Circus Being Enlarged At Each End, And A Canal Sunk Round It, Several Of The Young Nobility Drove Chariots, Drawn, Some By Four, And Others By Two Horses, And Likewise Rode Races On Single Horses. The Trojan Game Was Acted By Two Distinct Companies Of Boys, One Differing From The Other In Age And Rank. The Hunting Of Wild Beasts Was Presented For Five Days Successively; And On The Last Day A Battle Was Fought By Five Hundred Foot, Twenty Elephants, And Thirty Horse On Each Side. To Afford Room For This Engagement, The Goals Were Removed, And In Their Space Two Camps Were Pitched, Directly Opposite To Each Other. Wrestlers Likewise Performed For Three Days Successively, In A Stadium Provided For The Purpose In The Campus Martius. A Lake Having Been Dug In The Little Codeta , Ships Of The Tyrian And Egyptian Fleets, Containing Two, Three, And Four Banks Of Oars, With A Number Of Men On Board, Afforded An Animated Representation Of A Sea-fight. To These Various Diversions There Flocked Such Crowds Of Spectators From All Parts, That Most Of The Strangers Were Obliged To Lodge In Tents Erected In The Streets, Or Along The Roads Near The City. Several In The Throng Were Squeezed To Death, Amongst Whom Were Two Senators.</a> <span class="flex">60</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="61">Xl. Turning Afterwards His Attention To The Regulation Of The Commonwealth, He Corrected The Calendar , Which Had For  Some Time Become Extremely Confused, Through The Unwarrantable Liberty Which The Pontiffs Had Taken In The Article Of Intercalation. To Such A Height Had This Abuse Proceeded, That Neither The Festivals Designed For The Harvest Fell In Summer, Nor Those For The Vintage In Autumn. He Accommodated The Year To The Course Of The Sun, Ordaining That In Future It Should Consist Of Three Hundred And Sixty-five Days Without Any Intercalary Month; And That Every Fourth Year An Intercalary Day Should Be Inserted. That The Year Might Thenceforth Commence Regularly With The Calends, Or First Of January, He Inserted Two Months Between November And December; So That The Year In Which This Regulation Was Made Consisted Of Fifteen Months, Including The Month Of Intercalation, Which, According To The Division Of Time Then In Use, Happened That Year.</a> <span class="flex">61</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="62">Xli. He Filled Up The Vacancies In The Senate, By Advancing Several Plebeians To The Rank Of Patricians, And Also Increased The Number Of Praetors, Aediles, Quaestors, And Inferior Magistrates; Restoring, At The Same Time, Such As Had Been Degraded By The Censors, Or Convicted Of Bribery At Elections. The Choice Of Magistrates He So Divided With The People, That, Excepting Only The Candidates For The Consulship, They Nominated One Half Of Them, And He The Other. The Method Which He Practised In Those Cases Was, To Recommend Such Persons As He Had Pitched Upon, By Bills Dispersed Through The Several Tribes To This Effect: “Caesar The Dictator To Such A Tribe , That By The Favour Of Your Votes They May Attain To The Honours For Which They Sue.” He Likewise Admitted To Offices The Sons Of Those Who Had Been Proscribed. The Trial Of Causes He Restricted To Two Orders Of Judges, The Equestrian And Senatorial; Excluding The Tribunes Of The Treasury Who Had Before Made A Third Class. The Revised Census Of The People He Ordered To Be Taken Neither In The Usual Manner Or Place, But Street By Street, By The Principal Inhabitants Of The Several Quarters Of The City; And He Reduced The Number Of Those Who Received Corn At The Public Cost, From Three Hundred And Twenty, To A Hundred And Fifty, Thousand. To Prevent Any Tumults On Account Of The Census, He Ordered That The Praetor Should Every Year Fill Up By Lot The Vacancies Occasioned By Death, From Those Who Were Not Enrolled For The Receipt Of Corn.</a> <span class="flex">62</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="65">Xliii. He Was Extremely Assiduous And Strict In The Administration Of Justice. He Expelled From The Senate Such Members As Were Convicted Of Bribery; And He Dissolved The Marriage Of A Man Of Pretorian Rank, Who Had Married A Lady Two Days After Her Divorce From A Former Husband, Although There Was No Suspicion That They Had Been Guilty Of Any Illicit Connection. He Imposed Duties On The Importation Of Foreign Goods. The Use Of Litters For Travelling, Purple Robes, And Jewels, He Permitted Only To Persons Of A Certain Age And Station, And On Particular Days. He Enforced A Rigid Execution Of The Sumptuary Laws; Placing Officers About The Markets, To Seize Upon All Meats Exposed To Sale Contrary To The Rules, And Bring Them To Him; Sometimes Sending His Lictors And Soldiers To  Carry Away Such Victuals As Had Escaped The Notice Of The Officers, Even When They Were Upon The Table.</a> <span class="flex">65</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="66">Xliv. His Thoughts Were Now Fully Employed From Day To Day On A Variety Of Great Projects For The Embellishment And Improvement Of The City, As Well As For Guarding And Extending The Bounds Of The Empire. In The First Place, He Meditated The Construction Of A Temple To Mars, Which Should Exceed In Grandeur Every Thing Of That Kind In The World. For This Purpose, He Intended To Fill Up The Lake On Which He Had Entertained The People With The Spectacle Of A Sea-fight. He Also Projected A Most Spacious Theatre Adjacent To The Tarpeian Mount; And Also Proposed To Reduce The Civil Law To A Reasonable Compass, And Out Of That Immense And Undigested Mass Of Statutes To Extract The Best And Most Necessary Parts Into A Few Books; To Make As Large A Collection As Possible Of Works In The Greek And Latin Languages, For The Public Use; The Province Of Providing And Putting Them In Proper Order Being Assigned To Marcus Varro. He Intended Likewise To Drain The Pomptine Marshes, To Cut A Channel For The Discharge Of The Waters Of The Lake Fucinus, To Form A Road From The Upper Sea Through The Ridge Of The Appenine To The Tiber; To Make A Cut Through The Isthmus Of Corinth, To Reduce The Dacians, Who Had Over-run Pontus And Thrace, Within Their Proper Limits, And Then To Make War Upon The Parthians, Through The Lesser Armenia, But Not To Risk A General Engagement With Them, Until He Had Made Some Trial Of Their Prowess In War. But In The Midst Of All His Undertakings And Projects, He Was Carried Off By Death; Before I Speak Of Which, It May Not Be Improper To Give An Account Of His Person, Dress, And Manners; Together With What Relates To His Pursuits, Both Civil And Military.</a> <span class="flex">66</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="67">Xlv. It Is Said That He Was Tall, Of A Fair Complexion, Round Limbed, Rather Full Faced, With Eyes Black And Piercing; And That He Enjoyed Excellent Health, Except Towards The Close Of His Life, When He Was Subject To Sudden Fainting-fits, And Disturbance In His Sleep. He Was Likewise Twice Seized With The Falling Sickness While Engaged In Active Service. He Was So Nice In The Care Of His Person, That He Not Only Kept The Hair Of His Head Closely Cut And Had His Face Smoothly Shaved, But  Even Caused The Hair On Other Parts Of The Body To Be Plucked Out By The Roots, A Practice For Which Some Persons Rallied Him. His Baldness Gave Him Much Uneasiness, Having Often Found Himself Upon That Account Exposed To The Jibes Of His Enemies. He Therefore Used To Bring Forward The Hair From The Crown Of His Head; And Of All The Honours Conferred Upon Him By The Senate And People, There Was None Which He Either Accepted Or Used With Greater Pleasure, Than The Right Of Wearing Constantly A Laurel Crown. It Is Said That He Was Particular In His Dress. For He Used The Latus Clavus  With Fringes About The Wrists, And Always Had It Girded About Him, But Rather Loosely. This Circumstance Gave Origin To The Expression Of Sylla, Who Often Advised The Nobles To Beware Of “The Ill-girt Boy.”</a> <span class="flex">67</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="68">Xlvi. He First Inhabited A Small House In The Suburra , But After His Advancement To The Pontificate, He Occupied A Palace Belonging To The State In The Via Sacra. Many Writers Say That He Liked His Residence To Be Elegant, And His Entertainments Sumptuous; And That He Entirely Took Down A Villa Near The Grove Of Aricia, Which He Had Built From The Foundation And Finished At A Vast Expense, Because It Did Not Exactly Suit His Taste, Although He Had At That Time But Slender Means, And Was In Debt; And That He Carried About In His Expeditions Tesselated And Marble Slabs For The Floor Of His Tent.</a> <span class="flex">68</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="69">Xlvii. They Likewise Report That He Invaded Britain In Hopes Of Finding Pearls , The Size Of Which He Would Compare Together, And Ascertain The Weight By Poising Them In His Hand; That He Would Purchase, At Any Cost, Gems, Carved Works, Statues, And Pictures, Executed By The Eminent Masters Of Antiquity; And That He Would Give For Young And Handy Slaves A Price So Extravagant, That He Forbad Its Being Entered In The Diary Of His Expenses.</a> <span class="flex">69</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="70">Xlviii. We Are Also Told, That In The Provinces He Constantly Maintained Two Tables, One For The Officers Of The Army, And The Gentry Of The Country, And The Other For Romans Of The Highest Rank, And Provincials Of The First Distinction. He Was So Very Exact In The Management Of His Domestic Affairs, Both Little And Great, That He Once Threw A Baker Into Prison, For Serving Him With A Finer Sort Of Bread Than His Guests; And Put To Death A Freed-man, Who Was A Particular Favourite, For Debauching The Lady Of A Roman Knight, Although No Complaint Had Been Made To Him Of The Affair.</a> <span class="flex">70</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="71">Xlix. The Only Stain Upon His Chastity Was His Having Cohabited With Nicomedes; And That Indeed Stuck To Him All The Days Of His Life, And Exposed Him To Much Bitter Raillery. I Will Not Dwell Upon Those Well-known Verses Of Calvus Licinius:</a> <span class="flex">71</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="74">L. It Is Admitted By All That He Was Much Addicted To Women, As Well As Very Expensive In His Intrigues With Them, And That He Debauched Many Ladies Of The Highest Quality; Among Whom Were Posthumia, The Wife Of Servius Sulpicius; Lollia, The Wife Of Aulus Gabinius; Tertulla, The Wife Of Marcus Crassus; And Mucia, The Wife Of Cneius Pompey. For It Is Certain That The Curios, Both Father And Son, And Many Others, Made It A Reproach To Pompey, “That To Gratify His Ambition, He Married The Daughter Of A Man, Upon Whose Account He Had Divorced His Wife, After Having Had Three Children By Her; And Whom He Used, With A Deep Sigh, To Call Aegisthus.”  But The Mistress He Most Loved, Was Servilia, The Mother Of Marcus Brutus, For Whom He Purchased, In His First Consulship After The Commencement Of Their Intrigue, A Pearl Which Cost Him Six Millions Of Sesterces; And In The Civil War, Besides Other Presents, Assigned To Her, For A Trifling Consideration, Some Valuable Farms When They Were Exposed To Public Auction. Many Persons Expressing Their Surprise At The Lowness Of The Price, Cicero Wittily Remarked, “To Let You Know The Real Value Of The Purchase, Between Ourselves, Tertia Was Deducted:” For Servilia Was Supposed To Have Prostituted Her Daughter Tertia To Caesar.</a> <span class="flex">74</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="76">Lii. In The Number Of His Mistresses Were Also Some Queens; Such As Eunoe, A Moor, The Wife Of Bogudes, To Whom And Her Husband He Made, As Naso Reports, Many Large Presents. But His Greatest Favourite Was Cleopatra, With Whom He Often Revelled All Night Until The Dawn Of Day, And Would Have Gone With Her Through Egypt In Dalliance, As Far As Aethiopia, In Her Luxurious Yacht, Had Not The Army Refused To Follow Him. He Afterwards Invited Her To Rome, Whence He Sent Her Back Loaded With Honours And Presents, And Gave Her Permission To Call By His Name A Son, Who, According To The Testimony Of Some Greek Historians, Resembled Caesar Both In Person And Gait. Mark Antony Declared In The Senate, That Caesar Had Acknowledged The Child As His Own; And That Caius Matias, Caius Oppius, And The Rest Of Caesar’s Friends Knew It To Be True. On Which Occasion, Oppius, As If It Had Been An Imputation Which He Was Called Upon To Refute, Published A Book To Shew, “That The Child Which Cleopatra Fathered Upon Caesar, Was Not His.” Helvius Cinna, Tribune Of The People, Admitted To Several Persons The Fact, That He Had A Bill Ready Drawn, Which Caesar Had Ordered Him To Get Enacted In His Absence, Allowing Him, With The Hope Of Leaving Issue, To Take Any Wife He Chose, And As Many Of Them As He Pleased; And To Leave No Room For Doubt Of His Infamous Character For Unnatural Lewdness And Adultery, Curio, The Father, Says, In One Of His Speeches, “He Was Every Woman’s Man, And Every Man’s Woman.”</a> <span class="flex">76</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="77">Liii. It Is Acknowledged Even By His Enemies, That In Regard To Wine, He Was Abstemious. A Remark Is Ascribed To Marcus Cato, “That Caesar Was The Only Sober Man Amongst All Those Who Were Engaged In The Design To Subvert  The Government.” In The Matter Of Diet, Caius Oppius Informs Us, “That He Was So Indifferent, That When A Person In Whose House He Was Entertained, Had Served Him With Stale, Instead Of Fresh, Oil , And The Rest Of The Company Would Not Touch It, He Alone Ate Very Heartily Of It, That He Might Not Seem To Tax The Master Of The House With Rusticity Or Want Of Attention.”</a> <span class="flex">77</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="78">Liv. But His Abstinence Did Not Extend To Pecuniary Advantages, Either In His Military Commands, Or Civil Offices; For We Have The Testimony Of Some Writers, That He Took Money From The Proconsul, Who Was His Predecessor In Spain, And From The Roman Allies In That Quarter, For The Discharge Of His Debts; And Plundered At The Point Of The Sword Some Towns Of The Lusitanians, Notwithstanding They Attempted No Resistance, And Opened Their Gates To Him Upon His Arrival Before Them. In Gaul, He Rifled The Chapels And Temples Of The Gods, Which Were Filled With Rich Offerings, And Demolished Cities Oftener For The Sake Of Their Spoil, Than For Any Ill They Had Done. By This Means Gold Became So Plentiful With Him, That He Exchanged It Through Italy And The Provinces Of The Empire For Three Thousand Sesterces The Pound. In His First Consulship He Purloined From The Capitol Three Thousand Pounds’ Weight Of Gold, And Substituted For It The Same Quantity Of Gilt Brass. He Bartered Likewise To Foreign Nations And Princes, For Gold, The Titles Of Allies And Kings; And Squeezed Out Of Ptolemy Alone Near Six Thousand Talents, In The Name Of Himself And Pompey. He Afterwards Supported The Expense Of The Civil Wars, And Of His Triumphs And Public Spectacles, By The Most Flagrant Rapine And Sacrilege.</a> <span class="flex">78</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="79">Lv. In Eloquence And Warlike Achievements, He Equalled At Least, If He Did Not Surpass, The Greatest Of Men. After His Prosecution Of Dolabella, He Was Indisputably Reckoned One Of The Most Distinguished Advocates. Cicero, In Recounting To Brutus The Famous Orators, Declares, “That He Does Not See That Caesar Was Inferior To Any One Of Them;” And Says, “That He  Had An Elegant, Splendid, Noble, And Magnificent Vein Of Eloquence.” And In A Letter To Cornelius Nepos, He Writes Of Him In The Following Terms: “What! Of All The Orators, Who, During The Whole Course Of Their Lives, Have Done Nothing Else, Which Can You Prefer To Him? Which Of Them Is More Pointed Or Terse In His Periods, Or Employs More Polished And Elegant Language?” In His Youth, He Seems To Have Chosen Strabo Caesar For His Model; From Whose Oration In Behalf Of The Sardinians He Has Transcribed Some Passages Literally Into His Divination. In His Delivery He Is Said To Have Had A Shrill Voice, And His Action Was Animated, But Not Ungraceful. He Has Left Behind Him Some Speeches, Among Which Are Ranked A Few That Are Not Genuine, Such As That On Behalf Of Quintus Metellus. These Augustus Supposes, With Reason, To Be Rather The Production Of Blundering Short-hand Writers, Who Were Not Able To Keep Pace With Him In The Delivery, Than Publications Of His Own. For I Find In Some Copies That The Title Is Not “For Metellus,” But “What He Wrote To Metellus;” Whereas The Speech Is Delivered In The Name Of Caesar, Vindicating Metellus And Himself From The Aspersions Cast Upon Them By Their Common Defamers. The Speech Addressed “To His Soldiers In Spain,” Augustus Considers Likewise As Spurious. We Meet With Two Under This Title; One Made, As Is Pretended, In The First Battle, And The Other In The Last; At Which Time, Asinius Pollio Says, He Had Not Leisure To Address The Soldiers, On Account Of The Suddenness Of The Enemy’s Attack.</a> <span class="flex">79</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="80">Lvi. He Has Likewise Left Commentaries Of His Own Actions Both In The War In Gaul, And In The Civil War With Pompey; For The Author Of The Alexandrian, African, And Spanish Wars Is Not Known With Any Certainty. Some Think They Are The Production Of Oppius, And Some Of Hirtius; The Latter Of Whom Composed The Last Book, Which Is Imperfect, Of The Gallic War. Of Caesar’s Commentaries, Cicero, In His Brutus, Speaks Thus: “He Wrote His Commentaries In A Manner Deserving Of Great Approbation: They Are Plain, Precise, And Elegant, Without Any Affectation Of Rhetorical Ornament. In Having Thus Prepared Materials For Others Who Might Be Inclined To Write His History, He May Perhaps Have Encouraged Some Silly Creatures To Enter Upon Such A Work, Who Will Needs Be Dressing Up His Actions In All The Extravagance A  Bombast; But He Has Discouraged Wise Men From Ever Attempting The Subject.” Hirtius Delivers His Opinion Of These Commentaries In The Following Terms: “So Great Is The Approbation With Which They Are Universally Perused, That, Instead Of Rousing, He Seems To Have Precluded, The Efforts Of Any Future Historian. Yet, With Respect To This Work, We Have More Reason To Admire Him Than Others; For They Only Know How Well And Correctly He Has Written, But We Know, Likewise, How Easily And Quickly He Did It.” Pollio Asinius Thinks That They Were Not Drawn Up With Much Care, Or With A Due Regard To Truth; For He Insinuates That Caesar Was Too Hasty Of Belief In Regard To What Was Performed By Others Under His Orders; And That, He Has Not Given A Very Faithful Account Of His Own Acts, Either By Design, Or Through Defect Of Memory; Expressing At The Same Time An Opinion That Caesar Intended A New And More Correct Edition. He Has Left Behind Him Likewise Two Books On Analogy, With The Same Number Under The Title Of Anti-cato, And A Poem Entitled The Itinerary. Of These Books, He Composed The First Two In His Passage Over The Alps, As He Was Returning To The Army After Making His Circuit In Hither-gaul; The Second Work About The Time Of The Battle Of Munda; And The Last During The Four-and-twenty Days He Employed In His Journey From Rome To Farther-spain. There Are Extant Some Letters Of His To The Senate, Written In A Manner Never Practised By Any Before Him; For They Are Distinguished Into Pages In The Form Of A Memorandum Book Whereas The Consuls And Commanders Till Then, Used Constantly In Their Letters To Continue The Line Quite Across The Sheet, Without Any Folding Or Distinction Of Pages. There Are Extant Likewise Some Letters From Him To Cicero, And Others To His Friends, Concerning His Domestic Affairs; In Which, If There Was Occasion For Secrecy, He Wrote In Cyphers; That Is, He Used The Alphabet In Such A Manner, That Not A Single Word Could Be Made Out. The Way To Decipher Those Epistles Was To Substitute The Fourth For The First Letter, As D For A, And So For The Other Letters Respectively. Some Things Likewise Pass Under His Name, Said To Have Been Written By Him When A Boy, Or A Very Young Man; As The Encomium Of Hercules, A Tragedy Entitled Oedipus, And A Collection Of Apophthegms; All Which Augustus Forbad To Be Published, In A Short And Plain Letter To Pompeius Macer, Who Was Employed By Him In The Arrangement Of His Libraries.</a> <span class="flex">80</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="82">Lviii. In His Expeditions, It Is Difficult To Say Whether His Caution Or His Daring Was Most Conspicuous. He Never Marched His Army By Roads Which Were Exposed To Ambuscades, Without Having Previously Examined The Nature Of The Ground By His Scouts. Nor Did He Cross Over To Britain, Before He Had Carefully Examined, In Person , The Navigation, The Harbours, And The Most Convenient Point Of Landing In The Island. When Intelligence Was Brought To Him Of The Siege Of His Camp In Germany, He Made His Way To His Troops, Through The Enemy’s Stations, In A Gaulish Dress. He Crossed The Sea From Brundisium And Dyrrachium, In The Winter, Through The Midst Of The Enemy’s Fleets; And The Troops, Under Orders To Join Him, Being Slow In Their Movements, Notwithstanding Repeated Messages To Hurry Them, But To No Purpose, He At Last Went Privately, And Alone, Aboard A Small Vessel In The Night Time, With His Head Muffled Up; Nor Did He Make Himself Known, Or Suffer The Master To Put About, Although The Wind Blew Strong Against Them, Until They Were Ready To Sink.</a> <span class="flex">82</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="83">Lix. He Was Never Deterred From Any Enterprise, Nor Retarded In The Prosecution Of It, By Superstition . When A Victim, Which He Was About To Offer In Sacrifice, Made Its  Escape, He Did Not Therefore Defer His Expedition Against Scipio And Juba. And Happening To Fall, Upon Stepping Out Of The Ship, He Gave A Lucky Turn To The Omen, By Exclaiming, “I Hold Thee Fast, Africa.” To Chide The Prophecies Which Were Spread Abroad, That The Name Of The Scipios Was, By The Decrees Of Fate, Fortunate And Invincible In That Province, He Retained In The Camp A Profligate Wretch, Of The Family Of The Cornelii, Who, On Account Of His Scandalous Life, Was Surnamed Salutio.</a> <span class="flex">83</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="84">Lx. He Not Only Fought Pitched Battles, But Made Sudden Attacks When An Opportunity Offered; Often At The End Of A March, And Sometimes During The Most Violent Storms, When Nobody Could Imagine He Would Stir. Nor Was He Ever Backward In Fighting, Until Towards The End Of His Life. He Then Was Of Opinion, That The Oftener He Had Been Crowned With Success, The Less He Ought To Expose Himself To New Hazards; And That Nothing He Could Gain By A Victory Would Compensate For What He Might Lose By A Miscarriage. He Never Defeated The Enemy Without Driving Them From Their Camp; And Giving Them No Time To Rally Their Forces. When The Issue Of A Battle Was Doubtful, He Sent Away All The Horses, And His Own First, That Having No Means Of Flight, They Might Be Under The Greater Necessity Of Standing Their Ground.</a> <span class="flex">84</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="85">Lxi. He Rode A Very Remarkable Horse, With Feet Almost Like Those Of A Man, The Hoofs Being Divided In Such A Manner As To Have Some Resemblance To Toes. This Horse He Had Bred Himself, And The Soothsayers Having Interpreted These Circumstances Into An Omen That Its Owner Would Be Master Of The World, He Brought Him Up With Particular Care, And Broke Him In Himself, As The Horse Would Suffer No One Else To Mount Him. A Statue Of This Horse Was Afterwards Erected By Caesar’s Order Before The Temple Of Venus Genitrix.</a> <span class="flex">85</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="86">Lxii. He Often Rallied His Troops, When They Were Giving Way, By His Personal Efforts; Stopping Those Who Fled, Keeping Others In Their Ranks, And Seizing Them By Their Throat Turned Them Towards The Enemy; Although Numbers Were So Terrified, That An Eagle-bearer , Thus Stopped, Made A Thrust At Him With  The Spear-head; And Another, Upon A Similar Occasion, Left The Standard In His Hand.</a> <span class="flex">86</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="87">Lxiii. The Following Instances Of His Resolution Are Equally, And Even More Remarkable. After The Battle Of Pharsalia, Having Sent His Troops Before Him Into Asia, As He Was Passing The Straits Of The Hellespont In A Ferry-boat, He Met With Lucius Cassius, One Of The Opposite Party, With Ten Ships Of War; And So Far From Endeavouring To Escape, He Went Alongside His Ship, And Calling Upon Him To Surrender, Cassius Humbly Gave Him His Submission.</a> <span class="flex">87</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="88">Lxiv. At Alexandria, In The Attack Of A Bridge, Being Forced By A Sudden Sally Of The Enemy Into A Boat, And Several Others Hurrying In With Him, He Leaped Into The Sea, And Saved Himself By Swimming To The Next Ship, Which Lay At The Distance Of Two Hundred Paces; Holding Up His Left Hand Out Of The Water, For Fear Of Wetting Some Papers Which He Held In It; And Pulling His General’s Cloak After Him With His Teeth, Lest It Should Fall Into The Hands Of The Enemy.</a> <span class="flex">88</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="89">Lxv. He Never Valued A Soldier For His Moral Conduct Or His Means, But For His Courage Only; And Treated His Troops With A Mixture Of Severity And Indulgence; For He Did Not Always Keep A Strict Hand Over Them, But Only When The Enemy Was Near. Then Indeed He Was So Strict A Disciplinarian, That He Would Give No Notice Of A March Or A Battle Until The Moment Of Action, In Order That The Troops Might Hold Themselves In Readiness For Any Sudden Movement; And He Would Frequently Draw Them Out Of The Camp Without Any Necessity For It, Especially In Rainy Weather, And Upon Holy-days. Sometimes, Giving Them Orders Not To Lose Sight Of Him, He Would Suddenly Depart By Day Or By Night, And Lengthen The Marches In Order To Tire Them Out, As They Followed Him At A Distance.</a> <span class="flex">89</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="90">Lxvi. When At Any Time His Troops Were Dispirited By Reports Of The Great Force Of The Enemy, He Rallied Their Courage; Not By Denying The Truth Of What Was Said, Or By Diminishing The Facts, But, On The Contrary, By Exaggerating Every Particular.  Accordingly, When His Troops Were In Great Alarm At The Expected Arrival Of King Juba, He Called Them Together, And Said, “I Have To Inform You That In A Very Few Days The King Will Be Here, With Ten Legions, Thirty Thousand Horse, A Hundred Thousand Light-armed Foot, And Three Hundred Elephants. Let None Of You, Therefore, Presume To Make Further Enquiry, Or Indulge In Conjectures, But Take My Word For What I Tell You, Which I Have From Undoubted Intelligence; Otherwise I Shall Put Them Aboard An Old Crazy Vessel, And Leave Them Exposed To The Mercy Of The Winds, To Be Transported To Some Other Country.”</a> <span class="flex">90</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="91">Lxvii. He Neither Noticed All Their Transgressions, Nor Punished Them According To Strict Rule. But For Deserters And Mutineers He Made The Most Diligent Enquiry, And Their Punishment Was Most Severe: Other Delinquencies He Would Connive At. Sometimes, After A Great Battle Ending In Victory, He Would Grant Them A Relaxation From All Kinds Of Duty, And Leave Them To Revel At Pleasure; Being Used To Boast, “That His Soldiers Fought Nothing The Worse For Being Well Oiled.” In His Speeches, He Never Addressed Them By The Title Of “Soldiers,” But By The Kinder Phrase Of “Fellow-soldiers;” And Kept Them In Such Splendid Order, That Their Arms Were Ornamented With Silver And Gold, Not Merely For Parade, But To Render The Soldiers More Resolute To Save Them In Battle, And Fearful Of Losing Them. He Loved His Troops To Such A Degree, That When He Heard Of The Defeat Of Those Under Titurius, He Neither Cut His Hair Nor Shaved His Beard, Until He Had Revenged It Upon The Enemy; By Which Means He Engaged Their Devoted Affection, And Raised Their Valour To The Highest Pitch.</a> <span class="flex">91</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="92">Lxviii. Upon His Entering On The Civil War, The Centurions Of Every Legion Offered, Each Of Them, To Maintain A Horseman At His Own Expense, And The Whole Army Agreed To Serve Gratis, Without Either Corn Or Pay; Those Amongst Them Who Were Rich, Charging Themselves With The Maintenance Of The Poor. No One Of Them, During The Whole Course Of The War, Deserted To The Enemy; And Many Of Those Who Were Made Prisoners, Though They Were Offered Their Lives, Upon Condition Of Bearing Arms Against Him, Refused To Accept The Terms. They Endured Want, And Other Hardships, Not Only  When They Were Besieged Themselves, But When They Besieged Others, To Such A Degree, That Pompey, When Blocked Up In The Neighbourhood Of Dyrrachium, Upon Seeing A Sort Of Bread Made Of An Herb, Which They Lived Upon, Said, “I Have To Do With Wild Beasts,” And Ordered It Immediately To Be Taken Away; Because, If His Troops Should See It, Their Spirit Might Be Broken By Perceiving The Endurance And Determined Resolution Of The Enemy. With What Bravery They Fought, One Instance Affords Sufficient Proof; Which Is, That After An Unsuccessful Engagement At Dyrrachium, They Called For Punishment; Insomuch That Their General Found It More Necessary To Comfort Than To Punish Them. In Other Battles, In Different Quarters, They Defeated With Ease Immense Armies Of The Enemy, Although They Were Much Inferior To Them In Number. In Short, One Cohort Of The Sixth Legion Held Out A Fort Against Four Legions Belonging To Pompey, During Several Hours; Being Almost Every One Of Them Wounded By The Vast Number Of Arrows Discharged Against Them, And Of Which There Were Found Within The Ramparts A Hundred And Thirty Thousand. This Is No Way Surprising, When We Consider The Conduct Of Some Individuals Amongst Them; Such As That Of Cassius Scaeva, A Centurion, Or Caius Acilius, A Common Soldier, Not To Speak Of Others. Scaeva, After Having An Eye Struck Out, Being Run Through The Thigh And The Shoulder, And Having His Shield Pierced In An Hundred And Twenty Places, Maintained Obstinately The Guard Of The Gate Of A Fort, With The Command Of Which He Was Intrusted. Acilius, In The Sea-fight At Marseilles, Having Seized A Ship Of The Enemy’s With His Right Hand, And That Being Cut Off, In Imitation Of That Memorable Instance Of Resolution In Cynaegirus Amongst The Greeks, Boarded The Enemy’s Ship, Bearing Down All Before Him With The Boss Of His Shield.</a> <span class="flex">92</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="93">Lxix. They Never Once Mutinied During All The Ten Years Of The Gallic War, But Were Sometimes Refractory In The Course Of The Civil War. However, They Always Returned Quickly To Their Duty, And That Not Through The Indulgence, But In Submission To The Authority, Of Their General; For He Never Yielded To Them When They Were Insubordinate, But Constantly Resisted Their Demands. He Disbanded The Whole Ninth Legion With Ignominy At Placentia, Although Pompey Was Still In Arms, And Would  Not Receive Them Again Into His Service, Until They Had Not Only Made Repeated And Humble Entreaties, But Until The Ringleaders In The Mutiny Were Punished.</a> <span class="flex">93</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="94">Lxx. When The Soldiers Of The Tenth Legion At Rome Demanded Their Discharge And Rewards For Their Service, With Violent Threats And No Small Danger To The City, Although The War Was Then Raging In Africa, He Did Not Hesitate, Contrary To The Advice Of His Friends, To Meet The Legion, And Disband It. But Addressing Them By The Title Of “Quirites,” Instead Of “Soldiers,” He By This Single Word So Thoroughly Brought Them Round And Changed Their Determination, That They Immediately Cried Out, They Were His “Soldiers,” And Followed Him To Africa, Although He Had Refused Their Service. He Nevertheless Punished The Most Mutinous Among Them, With The Loss Of A Third Of Their Share In The Plunder, And The Land Destined For Them.</a> <span class="flex">94</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="95">Lxxi. In The Service Of His Clients, While Yet A Young Man, He Evinced Great Zeal And Fidelity. He Defended The Cause Of A Noble Youth, Masintha, Against King Hiempsal, So Strenuously, That In A Scuffle Which Took Place Upon The Occasion, He Seized By The Beard The Son Of King Juba; And Upon Masintha’s Being Declared Tributary To Hiempsal, While The Friends Of The Adverse Party Were Violently Carrying Him Off, He Immediately Rescued Him By Force, Kept Him Concealed In His House A Long Time, And When, At The Expiration Of His Praetorship, He Went To Spain, He Took Him Away In His Litter, In The Midst Of His Lictors Bearing The Fasces, And Others Who Had Come To Attend And Take Leave Of Him.</a> <span class="flex">95</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="96">Lxxii. He Always Treated His Friends With Such Kindness And Good-nature, That When Caius Oppius, In Travelling With Him Through A Forest, Was Suddenly Taken Ill, He Resigned To Him The Only Place There Was To Shelter Them At Night, And Lay Upon The Ground In The Open Air. When He Had Placed Himself At The Head Of Affairs, He Advanced Some Of His Faithful Adherents, Though Of Mean Extraction, To The Highest Offices; And When He Was Censured For This Partiality, He Openly Said, “Had I Been Assisted By Robbers And Cut-throats In The Defence Of My Honour, I Should Have Made Them The Same Recompense.”</a> <span class="flex">96</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="98">Lxxiv. His Temper Was Also Naturally Averse To Severity In Retaliation. After He Had Captured The Pirates, By Whom He Had Been Taken, Having Sworn That He Would Crucify Them, He Did So Indeed; But He First Ordered Their Throats To Be Cut . He Could Never Bear The Thought Of Doing Any Harm To Cornelius Phagitas, Who Had Dogged Him In The Night When He Was Sick And A Fugitive, With The Design Of Carrying Him To Sylla, And From Whose Hands He Had Escaped With Some Difficulty By Giving Him A Bribe. Philemon, His Amanuensis, Who Had Promised His Enemies To Poison Him, He Put To Death Without Torture. When He Was Summoned As A Witness Against Publicus Clodius, His Wife Pompeia’s Gallant, Who Was Prosecuted For The Profanation Of Religious Ceremonies, He Declared He Knew Nothing Of The Affair, Although His Mother Aurelia, And His Sister Julia, Gave The Court An Exact And Full Account Of The Circumstances. And Being Asked Why Then He Had Divorced His Wife? “Because,” He Said, “My Family Should Not Only Be Free From Guilt, But Even From The Suspicion Of It.”</a> <span class="flex">98</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="99">Lxxv. Both In His Administration And His Conduct Towards The Vanquished Party In The Civil War, He Showed A Wonderful Moderation And Clemency. For While Pompey Declared That He Would Consider Those As Enemies Who Did Not Take Arms In Defence Of The Republic, He Desired It To Be Understood, That He  Should Regard Those Who Remained Neuter As His Friends. With Regard To All Those To Whom He Had, On Pompey’s Recommendation, Given Any Command In The Army, He Left Them At Perfect Liberty To Go Over To Him, If They Pleased. When Some Proposals Were Made At Ileria  For A Surrender, Which Gave Rise To A Free Communication Between The Two Camps, And Afranius And Petreius, Upon A Sudden Change Of Resolution, Had Put To The Sword All Caesar’s Men Who Were Found In The Camp, He Scorned To Imitate The Base Treachery Which They Had Practised Against Himself. On The Field Of Pharsalia, He Called Out To The Soldiers “To Spare Their Fellow-citizens,” And Afterwards Gave Permission To Every Man In His Army To Save An Enemy. None Of Them, So Far As Appears, Lost Their Lives But In Battle, Excepting Only Afranius, Faustus, And Young Lucius Caesar; And It Is Thought That Even They Were Put To Death Without His Consent. Afranius And Faustus Had Borne Arms Against Him, After Obtaining Their Pardon; And Lucius Caesar Had Not Only In The Most Cruel Manner Destroyed With Fire And Sword His Freed-men And Slaves, But Cut To Pieces The Wild Beasts Which He Had Prepared For The Entertainment Of The People. And Finally, A Little Before His Death, He Permitted All Whom He Had Not Before Pardoned, To Return Into Italy, And To Bear Offices Both Civil And Military. He Even Replaced The Statues Of Sylla And Pompey, Which Had Been Thrown Down By The Populace. And After This, Whatever Was Devised Or Uttered, He Chose Rather To Check Than To Punish It. Accordingly, Having Detected Certain Conspiracies And Nocturnal Assemblies, He Went No Farther Than To Intimate By A Proclamation That He Knew Of Them; And As To Those Who Indulged Themselves In The Liberty Of Reflecting Severely Upon Him, He Only Warned Them In A Public Speech Not To Persist In Their Offence. He Bore With Great Moderation A Virulent Libel Written Against Him By Aulus Caecinna, And The Abusive Lampoons Of Pitholaus, Most Highly Reflecting On His Reputation.</a> <span class="flex">99</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="100">Lxxvi. His Other Words And Actions, However, So Far Outweigh All His Good Qualities, That It Is Thought He Abused His Power, And Was Justly Cut Off. For He Not Only Obtained Excessive Honours, Such As The Consulship Every Year, The Dictatorship For Life, And The Censorship, But Also The Title Of Emperor ,  He Likewise Appointed To The Management Of The Mint, And The Public Revenue Of The State, Some Servants Of His Own Household; And Entrusted The Command Of Three Legions, Which He Left At Alexandria, To An Old Catamite Of His, The Son Of His Freed-man Rufinus.</a> <span class="flex">100</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="101">Lxxvii. He Was Guilty Of The Same Extravagance In The Language He Publicly Used, As Titus Ampius Informs Us; According To Whom He Said, “The Republic Is Nothing But A Name, Without Substance Or Reality. Sylla Was An Ignorant Fellow To Abdicate The Dictatorship. Men Ought To Consider What Is Becoming When They Talk With Me, And Look Upon What I Say As A Law.” To Such A Pitch Of Arrogance Did He Proceed, That When A Soothsayer Announced To Him The Unfavourable Omen, That The Entrails Of A Victim Offered For Sacrifice Were Without A Heart, He Said, “The Entrails Will Be More Favourable When I Please; And It Ought Not To Be Regarded As A Prodigy That A Beast Should Be Found Wanting A Heart.”</a> <span class="flex">101</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="102">Lxxviii. But What Brought Upon Him The Greatest Odium, And Was Thought An Unpardonable Insult, Was His Receiving The Whole Body Of The Conscript Fathers Sitting, Before The Temple Of Venus Genitrix, When They Waited Upon Him With A Number Of Decrees, Conferring On Him The Highest Dignities. Some Say That, On His Attempting To Rise, He Was Held Down By Cornelius Balbus; Others, That He Did Not Attempt To Rise At All, But Frowned On Caius Trebatius, Who Suggested To Him That He Should Stand Up To Receive The Senate. This Behaviour Appeared The More Intolerable In Him, Because, When One Of The Tribunes Of The People, Pontius Aquila, Would Not Rise Up To Him, As He Passed By The Tribunes’ Seat During His Triumph, He Was So Much Offended, That He Cried Out, “Well Then, You Tribune, Aquila, Oust Me From The Government.” And For Some Days Afterwards, He Never Promised A Favour To Any Person, Without This Proviso, “If Pontus Aquila Will Give Me Leave.”</a> <span class="flex">102</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="103">Lxxix. To This Extraordinary Mark Of Contempt For The Senate, He Added Another Affront Still More Outrageous. For When, After The Sacred Rites Of The Latin Festival, He Was Returning Home, Amidst The Immoderate And Unusual Acclamations  Of The People, A Man In The Crowd Put A Laurel Crown, Encircled With A White Fillet , On One Of His Statues; Upon Which, The Tribunes Of The People, Epidius Marullus, And Caesetius Flavus, Ordered The Fillet To Be Removed From The Crown, And The Man To Be Taken To Prison. Caesar, Being Much Concerned Either That The Idea Of Royalty Had Been Suggested To So Little Purpose, Or, As Was Said, That He Was Thus Deprived Of The Merit Of Refusing It, Reprimanded The Tribunes Very Severely, And Dismissed Them From Their Office. From That Day Forward, He Was Never Able To Wipe Off The Scandal Of Affecting The Name Of King, Although He Replied To The Populace, When They Saluted Him By That Title, “I Am Caesar, And No King.” And At The Feast Of The Lupercalia , When The Consul Antony Placed A Crown Upon His Head In The Rostra Several Times, He As Often Put It Away, And Sent It To The Capitol For Jupiter, The Best And The Greatest. A Report Was Very Current, That He Had A Design Of Withdrawing To Alexandria Or Ilium, Whither He Proposed To Transfer The Imperial Power, To Drain Italy By New Levies, And To Leave The Government Of The City To Be Administered By His Friends. To This Report It Was Added, That In The Next Meeting Of The Senate, Lucius Cotta, One Of The Fifteen , Would Make A Motion, That As There Was In The Sibylline Books A Prophecy, That The Parthians Would Never Be Subdued But By A King, Caesar Should Have That Title Conferred Upon Him.</a> <span class="flex">103</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="104">Lxxx. For This Reason The Conspirators Precipitated The Execution Of Their Design , That They Might Not Be Obliged To Give Their Assent To The Proposal. Instead, Therefore, Of Caballing Any Longer Separately, In Small Parties, They Now United Their Counsels; The People Themselves Being Dissatisfied With The Present State Of Affairs, Both Privately And Publicly  Condemning The Tyranny Under Which They Lived, And Calling On Patriots To Assert Their Cause Against The Usurper. Upon The Admission Of Foreigners Into The Senate, A Hand-bill Was Posted Up In These Words: “A Good Deed! Let No One Shew A New Senator The Way To The House.” These Verses Were Likewise Currently Repeated:</a> <span class="flex">104</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="108">Lxxxi. Caesar Had Warning Given Him Of His Fate By Indubitable  Set Forward About The Fifth Hour. In His Way, Some Person Having Thrust Into His Hand A Paper, Warning Him Against The Plot, He Mixed It With Some Other Documents Which He Held In His Left Hand, Intending To Read It At Leisure. Victim After Victim Was Slain, Without Any Favourable Appearances In The Entrails; But Still, Disregarding All Omens, He Entered The Senate-house, Laughing At Spurinna As A False Prophet, Because The Ides Of March Were Come, Without Any Mischief Having Befallen Him. To Which The Soothsayer Replied, “They Are Come, Indeed, But Not Past.”</a> <span class="flex">108</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="109">Lxxxii. When He Had Taken His Seat, The Conspirators Stood Round Him, Under Colour Of Paying Their Compliments; And Immediately Tullius Cimber, Who Had Engaged To Commence The Assault, Advancing Nearer Than The Rest, As If He Had Some Favour To Request, Caesar Made Signs That He Should Defer His Petition To Some Other Time. Tullius Immediately Seized Him By The Toga, On Both Shoulders; At Which Caesar Crying Out, “Violence Is Meant!” One Of The Cassii Wounded Him A Little Below The Throat. Caesar Seized Him By The Arm, And Ran It Through With His Style ; And Endeavouring To Rush Forward Was Stopped By Another Wound. Finding Himself Now Attacked On All Hands With Naked Poniards, He Wrapped The Toga  About His Head, And At The Same Moment Drew The Skirt Round His Legs With His Left Hand, That He Might Fall More Decently With The Lower Part Of His Body Covered. He Was Stabbed With Three And Twenty Wounds, Uttering A Groan Only, But No Cry, At The First Wound; Although Some Authors Relate, That When Marcus Brutus Fell Upon Him, He Exclaimed, “What! Art Thou, Too, One Of Them? Thou, My Son!”  The Whole Assembly Instantly  Dispersing, He Lay For Some Time After He Expired, Until Three Of His Slaves Laid The Body On A Litter, And Carried It Home, With One Arm Hanging Down Over The Side. Among So Many Wounds, There Was None That Was Mortal, In The Opinion Of The Surgeon Antistius, Except The Second, Which He Received In The Breast. The Conspirators Meant To Drag His Body Into The Tiber As Soon As They Had Killed Him; To Confiscate His Estate, And Rescind All His Enactments; But They Were Deterred By Fear Of Mark Antony, And Lepidus, Caesar’s Master Of The Horse, And Abandoned Their Intentions.</a> <span class="flex">109</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="110">Lxxxiii. At The Instance Of Lucius Piso, His Father-in-law, His Will Was Opened And Read In Mark Antony’s House. He Had Made It On The Ides [13Th] Of The Preceding September, At His Lavican Villa, And Committed It To The Custody Of The Chief Of The Vestal Virgins. Quintus Tubero Informs Us, That In All The Wills He Had Signed, From The Time Of His First Consulship To The Breaking Out Of The Civil War, Cneius Pompey Was Appointed His Heir, And That This Had Been Publicly Notified To The Army. But In His Last Will, He Named Three Heirs, The Grandsons Of His Sisters; Namely, Caius Octavius For Three Fourths Of His Estate, And Lucius Pinarius And Quintus Pedius For The Remaining Fourth. Other Heirs [In Remainder] Were Named At The Close Of The Will, In Which He Also Adopted Caius Octavius, Who Was To Assume His Name, Into His Family; And Nominated Most Of Those Who Were Concerned In His Death Among The Guardians Of His Son, If He Should Have Any; As Well As Decimus Brutus Amongst His Heirs Of The Second Order. Be Bequeathed To The Roman People His Gardens Near The Tiber, And Three Hundred Sesterces Each Man.</a> <span class="flex">110</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="111">Lxxxiv. Notice Of His Funeral Having Been Solemnly Proclaimed, A Pile Was Erected In The Campus Martius, Near The Tomb Of His Daughter Julia; And Before The Rostra Was Placed A Gilded Tabernacle, On The Model Of The Temple Of Venus Genitrix; Within Which Was An Ivory Bed, Covered With Purple And Cloth Of Gold. At The Head Was A Trophy, With The [Bloodstained] Robe In Which He Was Slain. It Being Considered That The Whole Day Would Not Suffice For Carrying The Funeral Oblations In Solemn Procession Before The Corpse, Directions Were Given For Every One, Without Regard To Order, To Carry Them From The City Into The Campus Martius, By What Way They Pleased. To Raise Pity And Indignation For His Murder, In The Plays Acted At The Funeral, A Passage Was Sung From Pacuvius’s Tragedy, Entitled, “The Trial For Arms:”</a> <span class="flex">111</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="115">Lxxxv. The Populace Ran From The Funeral, With Torches In Their Hands, To The Houses Of Brutus And Cassius, And Were Repelled With Difficulty. Going In Quest Of Cornelius Cinna, Who Had In A Speech, The Day Before, Reflected Severely Upon Caesar, And Mistaking For Him Helvius Cinna, Who Happened To Fall Into Their Hands, They Murdered The Latter, And Carried His Head About The City On The Point Of A Spear. They Afterwards Erected In The Forum A Column Of Numidian Marble, Formed Of One Stone Nearly Twenty Feet High, And Inscribed Upon It These Words, To The Father Of His Country. At This Column They Continued For A Long Time To Offer Sacrifices, Make Vows, And Decide Controversies, In Which They Swore By Caesar.</a> <span class="flex">115</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="116">Lxxxvi. Some Of Caesar’s Friends Entertained A Suspicion, That He Neither Desired Nor Cared To Live Any Longer, On Account Of His Declining Health; And For That Reason Slighted All The Omens Of Religion, And The Warnings Of His Friends. Others Are Of Opinion, That Thinking Himself Secure In The Late Decree Of The Senate, And Their Oaths, He Dismissed His Spanish Guards Who Attended Him With Drawn Swords. Others Again Suppose, That He Chose Rather To Face At Once The Dangers Which Threatened Him On All Sides, Than To Be For Ever On The Watch Against Them. Some Tell Us That He Used To Say, The Commonwealth Was More Interested In The Safety Of His Person Than Himself: For That He Had For Some Time Been Satiated With Power And Glory; But That The Commonwealth, If Any Thing Should Befall Him, Would Have No Rest, And, Involved In Another Civil War, Would Be In A Worse State Than Before.</a> <span class="flex">116</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="118">Lxxxviii. He Died In The Fifty-sixth Year Of His Age, And Was Ranked Amongst The Gods, Not Only By A Formal Decree, But In The Belief Of The Vulgar. For During The First Games Which Augustus, His Heir, Consecrated To His Memory, A Comet Blazed For Seven Days Together, Rising Always About Eleven O’clock; And It Was Supposed To Be The Soul Of Caesar, Now Received Into Heaven: For Which Reason, Likewise, He Is Represented On His Statue With A Star On His Brow. The Senate-house In Which He Was Slain, Was Ordered To Be Shut Up , And A Decree Made That The Ides Of March Should Be Called Parricidal, And The Senate Should Never More Assemble On That Day.</a> <span class="flex">118</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="119">Lxxxix. Scarcely Any Of Those Who Were Accessary To His Murder, Survived Him More Than Three Years, Or Died A Natural Death . They Were All Condemned By The Senate: Some Were Taken Off By One Accident, Some By Another. Part Of Them Perished At Sea, Others Fell In Battle; And Some Slew Themselves With The Same Poniard With Which They Had Stabbed Caesar .</a> <span class="flex">119</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="163">D. Octavius Caesar Augustus.</a> <span class="flex">163</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="164">I. That The Family Of The Octavii Was Of The First Distinction In Velitrae , Is Rendered Evident By Many Circumstances. For In The Most Frequented Part Of The Town, There Was, Not Long Since, A Street Named The Octavian; And An Altar Was To Be Seen, Consecrated To One Octavius, Who Being Chosen General In A War With Some Neighbouring People, The Enemy Making A Sudden Attack, While He Was Sacrificing To Mars, He Immediately Snatched The Entrails Of The Victim From Off The Fire, And Offered Them Half Raw Upon The Altar; After Which, Marching Out To Battle, He Returned Victorious. This Incident Gave Rise To A Law, By Which It Was Enacted, That In All Future Times The Entrails Should Be Offered To Mars In The Same Manner; And The Rest Of The Victim Be Carried To The Octavii.</a> <span class="flex">164</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="165">Ii. This Family, As Well As Several In Rome, Was Admitted Into The Senate By Tarquinius Priscus, And Soon Afterwards Placed By Servius Tullius Among The Patricians; But In Process Of Time It Transferred Itself To The Plebeian Order, And, After The Lapse Of A Long Interval, Was Restored By Julius Caesar To The Rank Of Patricians. The First Person Of The Family Raised By The Suffrages Of The People To The Magistracy, Was Caius Rufus. He Obtained The Quaestorship, And Had Two Sons, Cneius And Caius; From Whom Are Descended The Two Branches Of The Octavian Family, Which Have Had Very Different Fortunes. For Cneius, And His Descendants In Uninterrupted Succession, Held All The Highest Offices Of The State; Whilst Caius And His Posterity, Whether From Their Circumstances Or Their Choice, Remained In The Equestrian Order Until The Father Of Augustus. The Great-grandfather Of Augustus Served As A Military Tribune In The Second Punic War In Sicily, Under The Command Of Aemilius Pappus. His Grandfather Contented Himself With Bearing The Public Offices Of His Own Municipality, And Grew Old In The Tranquil Enjoyment Of An Ample Patrimony. Such Is The Account Given  By Different Authors. Augustus Himself, However, Tells Us Nothing More Than That He Was Descended Of An Equestrian Family, Both Ancient And Rich, Of Which His Father Was The First Who Obtained The Rank Of Senator. Mark Antony Upbraidingly Tells Him That His Great-grandfather Was A Freedman Of The Territory Of Thurium , And A Rope-maker, And His Grandfather A Usurer. This Is All The Information I Have Any Where Met With, Respecting The Ancestors Of Augustus By The Father’s Side.</a> <span class="flex">165</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="166">Iii. His Father Caius Octavius Was, From His Earliest Years, A Person Both Of Opulence And Distinction: For Which Reason I Am Surprised At Those Who Say That He Was A Money-dealer , And Was Employed In Scattering Bribes, And Canvassing For The Candidates At Elections, In The Campus Martius. For Being Bred Up In All The Affluence Of A Great Estate, He Attained With Ease To Honourable Posts, And Discharged The Duties Of Them With Much Distinction. After His Praetorship, He Obtained By Lot The Province Of Macedonia; In His Way To Which He Cut Off Some Banditti, The Relics Of The Armies Of Spartacus And Catiline, Who Had Possessed Themselves Of The Territory Of Thurium; Having Received From The Senate An Extraordinary Commission For That Purpose. In His Government Of The Province, He Conducted Himself With Equal Justice And Resolution; For He Defeated The Bessians And Thracians In A Great Battle, And Treated The Allies Of The Republic In Such A Manner, That There Are Extant Letters From M. Tullius Cicero, In Which He Advises And Exhorts His Brother Quintus, Who Then Held The Proconsulship Of Asia With No Great Reputation, To Imitate The Example Of His Neighbour Octavius, In Gaining The Affections Of The Allies Of Rome.</a> <span class="flex">166</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="167">Iv. After Quitting Macedonia, Before He Could Declare Himself A Candidate For The Consulship, He Died Suddenly, Leaving Behind Him A Daughter, The Elder Octavia, By Ancharia; And Another Daughter, Octavia The Younger, As Well As Augustus, By Atia, Who Was The Daughter Of Marcus Atius Balbus, And Julia, Sister To Caius Julius Caesar. Balbus Was, By The Father’s  Side, Of A Family Who Were Natives Of Aricia , And Many Of Whom Had Been In The Senate. By The Mother’s Side He Was Nearly Related To Pompey The Great; And After He Had Borne The Office Of Praetor, Was One Of The Twenty Commissioners Appointed By The Julian Law To Divide The Land In Campania Among The People. But Mark Antony, Treating With Contempt Augustus’s Descent Even By The Mother’s Side, Says That His Great Grand-father Was Of African Descent, And At One Time Kept A Perfumer’s Shop, And At Another, A Bake-house, In Aricia. And Cassius Of Parma, In A Letter, Taxes Augustus With Being The Son Not Only Of A Baker, But A Usurer. These Are His Words: “Thou Art A Lump Of Thy Mother’s Meal, Which A Money-changer Of Nerulum Taking From The Newest Bake-house Of Aricia, Kneaded Into Some Shape, With His Hands All Discoloured By The Fingering Of Money.”</a> <span class="flex">167</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="168">V. Augustus Was Born In The Consulship Of Marcus Tullius Cicero And Caius Antonius , Upon The Ninth Of The Calends Of October [The 23Rd September], A Little Before Sunrise, In The Quarter Of The Palatine Hill , And The Street Called The Ox-heads , Where Now Stands A Chapel Dedicated To Him, And Built A Little After His Death. For, As It Is Recorded In The Proceedings Of The Senate, When Caius Laetorius, A Young Man Of A Patrician Family, In Pleading Before The Senators For A Lighter Sentence, Upon His Being Convicted Of Adultery, Alleged, Besides His Youth And Quality, That He Was The Possessor, And As It Were The Guardian, Of The Ground Which The Divine Augustus First Touched Upon His Coming Into The World; And Entreated That  He Might Find Favour, For The Sake Of That Deity, Who Was In A Peculiar Manner His; An Act Of The Senate Was Passed, For The Consecration Of That Part Of His House In Which Augustus Was Born.</a> <span class="flex">168</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="169">Vi. His Nursery Is Shewn To This Day, In A Villa Belonging To The Family, In The Suburbs Of Velitrae; Being A Very Small Place, And Much Like A Pantry. An Opinion Prevails In The Neighbourhood, That He Was Also Born There. Into This Place No Person Presumes To Enter, Unless Upon Necessity, And With Great Devotion, From A Belief, For A Long Time Prevalent, That Such As Rashly Enter It Are Seized With Great Horror And Consternation, Which A Short While Since Was Confirmed By A Remarkable Incident. For When A New Inhabitant Of The House Had, Either By Mere Chance, Or To Try The Truth Of The Report, Taken Up His Lodging In That Apartment, In The Course Of The Night, A Few Hours Afterwards, He Was Thrown Out By Some Sudden Violence, He Knew Not How, And Was Found In A State Of Stupefaction, With The Coverlid Of His Bed, Before The Door Of The Chamber.</a> <span class="flex">169</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="170">Vii. While He Was Yet An Infant, The Surname Of Thurinus Was Given Him, In Memory Of The Birth-place Of His Family, Or Because, Soon After He Was Born, His Father Octavius Had Been Successful Against The Fugitive Slaves, In The Country Near Thurium. That He Was Surnamed Thurinus, I Can Affirm Upon Good Foundation, For When A Boy, I Had A Small Bronze Statue Of Him, With That Name Upon It In Iron Letters, Nearly Effaced By Age, Which I Presented To The Emperor , By Whom It Is Now Revered Amongst The Other Tutelary Deities In His Chamber. He Is Also Often Called Thurinus Contemptuously, By Mark Antony In His Letters; To Which He Makes Only This Reply: “I Am Surprised That My Former Name Should Be Made A Subject Of Reproach.” He Afterwards Assumed The Name Of Caius Caesar, And Then Of Augustus; The Former In Compliance With The Will Of His Great-uncle, And The Latter Upon A Motion Of Munatius Plancus In The Senate. For When Some Proposed To Confer Upon Him The Name Of Romulus, As Being, In A Manner, A Second Founder Of The City, It Was Resolved That He Should Rather Be Called Augustus, A Surname Not Only New, But Of More Dignity, Because Places Devoted To Religion, And Those In Which Anything  Is Consecrated By Augury, Are Denominated August, Either From The Word Auctus, Signifying Augmentation, Or Ab Avium Gestu, Gustuve, From The Flight And Feeding Of Birds; As Appears From This Verse Of Ennius:</a> <span class="flex">170</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="172">Viii. He Lost His Father When He Was Only Four Years Of Age; And, In His Twelfth Year, Pronounced A Funeral Oration In Praise Of His Grand-mother Julia. Four Years Afterwards, Having Assumed The Robe Of Manhood, He Was Honoured With Several Military Rewards By Caesar In His African Triumph, Although He Took No Part In The War, On Account Of His Youth. Upon His Uncle’s Expedition To Spain Against The Sons Of Pompey, He Was Followed By His Nephew, Although He Was Scarcely Recovered From A Dangerous Sickness; And After Being Shipwrecked At Sea, And Travelling With Very Few Attendants Through Roads That Were Infested With The Enemy, He At Last Came Up With Him. This Activity Gave Great Satisfaction To His Uncle, Who Soon Conceived An Increasing Affection For Him, On Account Of Such Indications Of Character. After The Subjugation Of Spain, While Caesar Was Meditating An Expedition Against The Dacians And Parthians, He Was Sent Before Him To Apollonia, Where He Applied Himself To His Studies; Until Receiving Intelligence That His Uncle Was Murdered, And That He Was Appointed His Heir, He Hesitated For Some Time Whether He Should Call To His Aid The Legions Stationed In The Neighbourhood; But He Abandoned The Design As Rash And Premature. However, Returning To Rome, He Took Possession Of His Inheritance, Although His Mother Was Apprehensive That Such A Measure Might Be Attended With Danger, And His Step-father, Marcius Philippus, A Man Of Consular Rank, Very Earnestly Dissuaded Him From It. From This Time, Collecting Together A Strong Military Force, He First Held The Government In Conjunction With Mark Antony And Marcus Lepidus, Then With Antony Only, For Nearly Twelve Years, And At Last In His Own Hands During A Period Of Four And Forty.</a> <span class="flex">172</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="173">Ix. Having Thus Given A Very Short Summary Of His Life, I Shall Prosecute The Several Parts Of It, Not In Order Of Time, But Arranging His Acts Into Distinct Classes, For The Sake Of  Perspicuity. He Was Engaged In Five Civil Wars, Namely Those Of Modena, Philippi, Perugia, Sicily, And Actium; The First And Last Of Which Were Against Antony, And The Second Against Brutus And Cassius; The Third Against Lucius Antonius, The Triumvir’s Brother, And The Fourth Against Sextus Pompeius, The Son Of Cneius Pompeius.</a> <span class="flex">173</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="174">X. The Motive Which Gave Rise To All These Wars Was The Opinion He Entertained That Both His Honour And Interest Were Concerned In Revenging The Murder Of His Uncle, And Maintaining The State Of Affairs He Had Established. Immediately After His Return From Apollonia, He Formed The Design Of Taking Forcible And Unexpected Measures Against Brutus And Cassius; But They Having Foreseen The Danger And Made Their Escape, He Resolved To Proceed Against Them By An Appeal To The Laws In Their Absence, And Impeach Them For The Murder. In The Mean Time, Those Whose Province It Was To Prepare The Sports In Honour Of Caesar’s Last Victory In The Civil War, Not Daring To Do It, He Undertook It Himself. And That He Might Carry Into Effect His Other Designs With Greater Authority, He Declared Himself A Candidate In The Room Of A Tribune Of The People Who Happened To Die At That Time, Although He Was Of A Patrician Family, And Had Not Yet Been In The Senate. But The Consul, Mark Antony, From Whom He Had Expected The Greatest Assistance, Opposing Him In His Suit, And Even Refusing To Do Him So Much As Common Justice, Unless Gratified With A Large Bribe, He Went Over To The Party Of The Nobles, To Whom He Perceived Sylla To Be Odious, Chiefly For Endeavouring To Drive Decius Brutus, Whom He Besieged In The Town Of Modena, Out Of The Province, Which Had Been Given Him By Caesar, And Confirmed To Him By The Senate. At The Instigation Of Persons About Him, He Engaged Some Ruffians To Murder His Antagonist; But The Plot Being Discovered, And Dreading A Similar Attempt Upon Himself, He Gained Over Caesar’s Veteran Soldiers, By Distributing Among Them All The Money He Could Collect. Being Now Commissioned By The Senate To Command The Troops He Had Gathered, With The Rank Of Praetor, And In Conjunction With Hirtius And Pansa, Who Had Accepted The Consulship, To Carry Assistance To Decius Brutus, He Put An End To The War By Two Battles In Three Months. Antony Writes, That In The Former Of These He Ran Away, And Two Days Afterwards Made His Appearance  Without His General’s Cloak And His Horse. In The Last Battle, However, It Is Certain That He Performed The Part Not Only Of A General, But A Soldier; For, In The Heat Of The Battle; When The Standard-bearer Of His Legion Was Severely Wounded, He Took The Eagle Upon His Shoulders, And Carried It A Long Time.</a> <span class="flex">174</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="175">Xi. In This War , Hirtius Being Slain In Battle, And Pansa Dying A Short Time Afterwards Of A Wound, A Report Was Circulated That They Both Were Killed Through His Means, In Order That, When Antony Fled, The Republic Having Lost Its Consuls, He Might Have The Victorious Armies Entirely At His Own Command. The Death Of Pansa Was So Fully Believed To Have Been Caused By Undue Means, That Glyco, His Surgeon, Was Placed In Custody, On A Suspicion Of Having Poisoned His Wound. And To This, Aquilius Niger Adds, That He Killed Hirtius, The Other Consul, In The Confusion Of The Battle, With His Own Hands.</a> <span class="flex">175</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="176">Xii. But Upon Intelligence That Antony, After His Defeat, Had Been Received By Marcus Lepidus, And That The Rest Of The Generals And Armies Had All Declared For The Senate, He, Without Any Hesitation, Deserted From The Party Of The Nobles; Alleging As An Excuse For His Conduct, The Actions And Sayings Of Several Amongst Them; For Some Said, “He Was A Mere Boy,” And Others Threw Out, “That He Ought To Be Promoted To Honours, And Cut Off,” To Avoid The Making Any Suitable Acknowledgment Either To Him Or The Veteran Legions. And The More To Testify His Regret For Having Before Attached Himself To The Other Faction, He Fined The Nursini In A Large Sum Of Money, Which They Were Unable To Pay, And Then Expelled Them From The Town, For Having Inscribed Upon A Monument, Erected At The Public Charge To Their Countrymen Who Were Slain In The Battle Of Modena, “That They Fell In The Cause Of Liberty.”</a> <span class="flex">176</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="177">Xiii. Having Entered Into A Confederacy With Antony And Lepidus, He Brought The War At Philippi To An End In Two Battles, Although He Was At That Time Weak, And Suffering From Sickness . In The First Battle He Was Driven From His Camp,  And With Some Difficulty Made His Escape To The Wing Of The Army Commanded By Antony. And Now, Intoxicated With Success, He Sent The Head Of Brutus  To Be Cast At The Foot Of Caesar’s Statue, And Treated The Most Illustrious Of The Prisoners Not Only With Cruelty, But With Abusive Language; Insomuch That He Is Said To Have Answered One Of Them Who Humbly Intreated That At Least He Might Not Remain Unburied, “That Will Be In The Power Of The Birds.” Two Others, Father And Son, Who Begged For Their Lives, He Ordered To Cast Lots Which Of Them Should Live, Or Settle It Between Themselves By The Sword; And Was A Spectator Of Both Their Deaths: For The Father Offering His Life To Save His Son, And Being Accordingly Executed, The Son Likewise Killed Himself Upon The Spot. On This Account, The Rest Of The Prisoners, And Amongst Them Marcus Favonius, Cato’s Rival, Being Led Up In Fetters, After They Had Saluted Antony, The General, With Much Respect, Reviled Octavius In The Foulest Language. After This Victory, Dividing Between Them The Offices Of The State, Mark Antony  Undertook To Restore Order In The East, While Caesar Conducted The Veteran Soldiers Back To Italy, And Settled Them In Colonies On The Lands Belonging To The Municipalities. But He Had The Misfortune To Please Neither The Soldiers Nor The Owners Of The Lands; One Party Complaining Of The Injustice Done Them, In Being Violently Ejected From Their Possessions, And The Other, That They Were Not Rewarded According To Their Merit.</a> <span class="flex">177</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="178">Xiv. At This Time He Obliged Lucius Antony, Who, Presuming Upon His Own Authority As Consul, And His Brother’s Power, Was Raising New Commotions, To Fly To Perugia, And Forced Him, By Famine, To Surrender At Last, Although Not Without Having Been Exposed To Great Hazards, Both Before The War And During Its Continuance. For A Common Soldier Having Got Into The Seats Of The Equestrian Order In The Theatre, At The Public Spectacles, Caesar Ordered Him To Be Removed By An Officer; And A Rumour Being Thence Spread By His Enemies, That He Had  Put The Man To Death By Torture, The Soldiers Flocked Together So Much Enraged, That He Narrowly Escaped With His Life. The Only Thing That Saved Him, Was The Sudden Appearance Of The Man, Safe And Sound, No Violence Having Been Offered Him. And Whilst He Was Sacrificing Under The Walls Of Perugia, He Nearly Fell Into The Hands Of A Body Of Gladiators, Who Sallied Out Of The Town.</a> <span class="flex">178</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="179">Xv. After The Taking Of Perugia , He Sentenced A Great Number Of The Prisoners To Death, Making Only One Reply To All Who Implored Pardon, Or Endeavoured To Excuse Themselves, “You Must Die.” Some Authors Write, That Three Hundred Of The Two Orders, Selected From The Rest, Were Slaughtered, Like Victims, Before An Altar Raised To Julius Caesar, Upon The Ides Of March [15Th April] . Nay, There Are Some Who Relate, That He Entered Upon The War With No Other View, Than That His Secret Enemies, And Those Whom Fear More Than Affection Kept Quiet, Might Be Detected, By Declaring Themselves, Now They Had An Opportunity, With Lucius Antony At Their Head; And That Having Defeated Them, And Confiscated Their Estates, He Might Be Enabled To Fulfil His Promises To The Veteran Soldiers.</a> <span class="flex">179</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="180">Xvi. He Soon Commenced The Sicilian War, But It Was Protracted By Various Delays During A Long Period ; At One Time For The Purpose Of Repairing His Fleets, Which He Lost Twice By Storm, Even In The Summer; At Another, While Patching Up A Peace, To Which He Was Forced By The Clamours Of The People, In Consequence Of A Famine Occasioned By Pompey’s Cutting Off The Supply Of Corn By Sea. But At Last, Having Built A New Fleet, And Obtained Twenty Thousand Manumitted Slaves , Who Were Given Him For The Oar, He Formed The Julian Harbour At Baiae, By Letting The Sea Into The Lucrine And Avernian Lakes; And Having Exercised His Forces There During The Whole Winter, He Defeated Pompey Betwixt Mylae And Naulochus; Although  Just As The Engagement Commenced, He Suddenly Fell Into Such A Profound Sleep, That His Friends Were Obliged To Wake Him To Give The Signal. This, I Suppose, Gave Occasion For Antony’s Reproach: “You Were Not Able To Take A Clear View Of The Fleet, When Drawn Up In Line Of Battle, But Lay Stupidly Upon Your Back, Gazing At The Sky; Nor Did You Get Up And Let Your Men See You, Until Marcus Agrippa Had Forced The Enemies’ Ships To Sheer Off.” Others Imputed To Him Both A Saying And An Action Which Were Indefensible; For, Upon The Loss Of His Fleets By Storm, He Is Reported To Have Said: “I Will Conquer In Spite Of Neptune;” And At The Next Circensian Games, He Would Not Suffer The Statue Of That God To Be Carried In Procession As Usual. Indeed He Scarcely Ever Ran More Or Greater Risks In Any Of His Wars Than In This. Having Transported Part Of His Army To Sicily, And Being On His Return For The Rest, He Was Unexpectedly Attacked By Demochares And Apollophanes, Pompey’s Admirals, From Whom He Escaped With Great Difficulty, And With One Ship Only. Likewise, As He Was Travelling On Foot Through The Locrian Territory To Rhegium, Seeing Two Of Pompey’s Vessels Passing By That Coast, And Supposing Them To Be His Own, He Went Down To The Shore, And Was Very Nearly Taken Prisoner. On This Occasion, As He Was Making His Escape By Some Bye-ways, A Slave Belonging To Aemilius Paulus, Who Accompanied Him, Owing Him A Grudge For The Proscription Of Paulus, The Father Of Aemilius, And Thinking He Had Now An Opportunity Of Revenging It, Attempted To Assassinate Him. After The Defeat Of Pompey, One Of His Colleagues , Marcus Lepidus, Whom He Had Summoned To His Aid From Africa, Affecting Great Superiority, Because He Was At The Head Of Twenty Legions, And Claiming For Himself The Principal Management Of Affairs In A Threatening Manner, He Divested Him Of His Command, But, Upon His Humble Submission, Granted Him His Life, But Banished Him For Life To Circeii.</a> <span class="flex">180</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="181">Xvii. The Alliance Between Him And Antony, Which Had Always Been Precarious, Often Interrupted, And Ill Cemented By Repeated Reconciliations, He At Last Entirely Dissolved. And To Make It Known To The World How Far Antony Had Degenerated From Patriotic Feelings, He Caused A Will Of His, Which Had Been Left At Rome, And In Which He Had Nominated Cleopatra’s Children, Amongst Others, As His Heirs, To Be Opened And Read In An Assembly Of The People. Yet Upon His Being Declared An Enemy, He Sent To Him All His Relations And Friends, Among Whom Were Caius Sosius And Titus Domitius, At That Time Consuls. He Likewise Spoke Favourably In Public Of The People Of Bologna, For Joining In The Association With The Rest Of Italy To Support His Cause, Because They Had, In Former Times, Been Under The Protection Of The Family Of The Antonii. And Not Long Afterwards He Defeated Him In A Naval Engagement Near Actium, Which Was Prolonged To So Late An Hour, That, After The Victory, He Was Obliged To Sleep On Board His Ship. From Actium He Went To The Isle Of Samoa To Winter; But Being Alarmed With The Accounts Of A Mutiny Amongst The Soldiers He Had Selected From The Main Body Of His Army Sent To Brundisium After The Victory, Who Insisted On Their Being Rewarded For Their Service And Discharged, He Returned To Italy. In His Passage Thither, He Encountered Two Violent Storms, The First Between The Promontories Of Peloponnesus And Aetolia, And The Other About The Ceraunian Mountains; In Both Which A Part Of His Liburnian Squadron Was Sunk, The Spars And Rigging Of His Own Ship Carried Away, And The Rudder Broken In Pieces. He Remained Only Twenty-seven Days At Brundisium, Until The Demands Of The Soldiers Were Settled, And Then Went, By Way Of Asia And Syria, To Egypt, Where Laying Siege To Alexandria, Whither Antony Had Fled With Cleopatra, He Made Himself Master Of It In A Short Time. He Drove Antony To Kill Himself, After He Had Used Every Effort To Obtain Conditions Of Peace, And He Saw His Corpse . Cleopatra He Anxiously Wished To Save For His Triumph; And When She Was Supposed To Have Been Bit To Death By An Asp, He Sent For The Psylli  To  Endeavour To Suck Out The Poison. He Allowed Them To Be Buried Together In The Same Grave, And Ordered A Mausoleum, Begun By Themselves, To Be Completed. The Eldest Of Antony’s Two Sons By Fulvia He Commanded To Be Taken By Force From The Statue Of Julius Caesar, To Which He Had Fled, After Many Fruitless Supplications For His Life, And Put Him To Death. The Same Fate Attended Caesario, Cleopatra’s Son By Caesar, As He Pretended, Who Had Fled For His Life, But Was Retaken. The Children Which Antony Had By Cleopatra He Saved, And Brought Up And Cherished In A Manner Suitable To Their Rank, Just As If They Had Been His Own Relations.</a> <span class="flex">181</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="182">Xviii. At This Time He Had A Desire To See The Sarcophagus And Body Of Alexander The Great, Which, For That Purpose, Were Taken Out Of The Cell In Which They Rested ; And After Viewing Them For Some Time, He Paid Honours To The Memory Of That Prince, By Offering A Golden Crown, And Scattering Flowers Upon The Body . Being Asked If He Wished To See The Tombs Of The Ptolemies Also; He Replied, “I Wish To See A King, Not Dead Men.”  He Reduced Egypt Into The Form Of A Province And To Render It More Fertile, And More Capable Of Supplying Rome With Corn, He Employed His Army To Scour The Canals, Into Which The Nile, Upon Its Rise, Discharges Itself; But Which During A Long Series Of Years Had Become Nearly Choked Up With Mud. To Perpetuate The Glory Of His Victory At Actium, He Built The City Of Nicopolis On That Part Of The Coast, And Established Games To Be Celebrated There Every Five Years; Enlarging Likewise An Old Temple Of Apollo, He Ornamented With Naval Trophies  The Spot On Which He Had Pitched His Camp, And Consecrated It To Neptune And Mars.</a> <span class="flex">182</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="185">Xx. He Conducted In Person Only Two Foreign Wars; The Dalmatian, Whilst He Was Yet But A Youth; And, After Antony’s Final Defeat, The Cantabrian. He Was Wounded In The Former Of These Wars; In One Battle He Received A Contusion In The Right Knee From A Stone—and In Another, He Was Much Hurt In  One Leg And Both Arms, By The Fall Of A Fridge . His Other Wars He Carried On By His Lieutenants; But Occasionally Visited The Army, In Some Of The Wars Of Pannonia And Germany, Or Remained At No Great Distance, Proceeding From Rome As Far As Ravenna, Milan, Or Aquileia.</a> <span class="flex">185</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="186">Xxi. He Conquered, However, Partly In Person, And Partly By His Lieutenants, Cantabria , Aquitania And Pannonia , Dalmatia, With All Illyricum And Rhaetia , Besides The Two Alpine Nations, The Vindelici And The Salassii . He Also Checked The Incursions Of The Dacians, By Cutting Off Three Of Their Generals With Vast Armies, And Drove The Germans Beyond The River Elbe; Removing Two Other Tribes Who Submitted, The Ubii And Sicambri, Into Gaul, And Settling Them In The Country Bordering On The Rhine. Other Nations Also, Which Broke Into Revolt, He Reduced To Submission. But He Never Made War Upon Any Nation Without Just And Necessary Cause; And Was So Far From Being Ambitious Either To Extend The Empire, Or Advance His Own Military Glory, That He Obliged The Chiefs Of Some Barbarous Tribes To Swear In The Temple Of Mars The Avenger , That They Would Faithfully Observe Their Engagements, And Not Violate The Peace Which They Had Implored. Of Some He Demanded A New Description Of Hostages, Their Women, Having Found From Experience That They Cared Little For Their Men When Given As Hostages; But He Always Afforded Them The Means Of Getting Back Their Hostages Whenever They Wished It. Even Those Who Engaged Most Frequently And With The Greatest Perfidy In Their Rebellion, He Never Punished More Severely Than By Selling Their Captives, On The Terms  Of Their Not Serving In Any Neighbouring Country, Nor Being Released From Their Slavery Before The Expiration Of Thirty Years. By The Character Which He Thus Acquired, For Virtue And Moderation, He Induced Even The Indians And Scythians, Nations Before Known To The Romans By Report Only, To Solicit His Friendship, And That Of The Roman People, By Ambassadors. The Parthians Readily Allowed His Claim To Armenia; Restoring At His Demand, The Standards Which They Had Taken From Marcus Crassus And Mark Antony, And Offering Him Hostages Besides. Afterwards, When A Contest Arose Between Several Pretenders To The Crown Of That Kingdom, They Refused To Acknowledge Any One Who Was Not Chosen By Him.</a> <span class="flex">186</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="187">Xxii. The Temple Of Janus Quirinus, Which Had Been Shut Twice Only, From The Era Of The Building Of The City To His Own Time, He Closed Thrice In A Much Shorter Period, Having Established Universal Peace Both By Sea And Land. He Twice Entered The City With The Honours Of An Ovation , Namely, After The War Of Philippi, And Again After That Of Sicily. He Had Also Three Curule Triumphs  For His Several Victories In  Dalmatia, At Actium, And Alexandria; Each Of Which Lasted Three Days.</a> <span class="flex">187</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="188">Xxiii. In All His Wars, He Never Received Any Signal Or Ignominious Defeat, Except Twice In Germany, Under His Lieutenants Lollius And Varus. The Former Indeed Had In It More Of Dishonour Than Disaster; But That Of Varus Threatened The Security Of The Empire Itself; Three Legions, With The Commander, His Lieutenants, And All The Auxiliaries, Being Cut Off. Upon Receiving Intelligence Of This Disaster, He Gave Orders For Keeping A Strict Watch Over The City, To Prevent Any Public Disturbance, And Prolonged The Appointments Of The Prefects In The Provinces, That The Allies Might Be Kept In Order By Experience Of Persons To Whom They Were Used. He Made A Vow To Celebrate The Great Games In Honour Of Jupiter, Optimus, Maximus, “If He Would Be Pleased To Restore The State To More Prosperous Circumstances.” This Had Formerly Been Resorted To In The Cimbrian And Marsian Wars. In Short, We Are Informed That He Was In Such Consternation At This Event, That He Let The Hair Of His Head And Beard Grow For Several Months, And Sometimes Knocked His Head Against The Door-posts, Crying Out, “O, Quintilius Varus! Give Me Back My Legions!” And  Ever After, He Observed The Anniversary Of This Calamity, As A Day Of Sorrow And Mourning.</a> <span class="flex">188</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="189">Xxiv. In Military Affairs He Made Many Alterations, Introducing Some Practices Entirely New, And Reviving Others, Which Had Become Obsolete. He Maintained The Strictest Discipline Among The Troops; And Would Not Allow Even His Lieutenants The Liberty To Visit Their Wives, Except Reluctantly, And In The Winter Season Only. A Roman Knight Having Cut Off The Thumbs Of His Two Young Sons, To Render Them Incapable Of Serving In The Wars, He Exposed Both Him And His Estate To Public Sale. But Upon Observing The Farmers Of The Revenue Very Greedy For The Purchase, He Assigned Him To A Freedman Of His Own, That He Might Send Him Into The Country, And Suffer Him To Retain His Freedom. The Tenth Legion Becoming Mutinous, He Disbanded It With Ignominy; And Did The Same By Some Others Which Petulantly Demanded Their Discharge; Withholding From Them The Rewards Usually Bestowed On Those Who Had Served Their Stated Time In The Wars. The Cohorts Which Yielded Their Ground In Time Of Action, He Decimated, And Fed With Barley. Centurions, As Well As Common Sentinels, Who Deserted Their Posts When On Guard, He Punished With Death. For Other Misdemeanors He Inflicted Upon Them Various Kinds Of Disgrace; Such As Obliging Them To Stand All Day Before The Praetorium, Sometimes In Their Tunics Only, And Without Their Belts, Sometimes To Carry Poles Ten Feet Long, Or Sods Of Turf.</a> <span class="flex">189</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="190">Xxv. After The Conclusion Of The Civil Wars, He Never, In Any Of His Military Harangues, Or Proclamations, Addressed Them By The Title Of “Fellow-soldiers,” But As “Soldiers” Only. Nor Would He Suffer Them To Be Otherwise Called By His Sons Or Step-sons, When They Were In Command; Judging The Former Epithet To Convey The Idea Of A Degree Of Condescension Inconsistent With Military Discipline, The Maintenance Of Order, And His Own Majesty, And That Of His House. Unless At Rome, In Case Of Incendiary Fires, Or Under The Apprehension Of Public Disturbances During A Scarcity Of Provisions, He Never Employed In His Army Slaves Who Had Been Made Freedmen, Except Upon Two Occasions; On One, For The Security Of The Colonies Bordering Upon Illyricum, And On The Other, To Guard  The Banks Of The River Rhine. Although He Obliged Persons Of Fortune, Both Male And Female, To Give Up Their Slaves, And They Received Their Manumission At Once, Yet He Kept Them Together Under Their Own Standard, Unmixed With Soldiers Who Were Better Born, And Armed Likewise After Different Fashion. Military Rewards, Such As Trappings, Collars, And Other Decorations Of Gold And Silver, He Distributed More Readily Than Camp Or Mural Crowns, Which Were Reckoned More Honourable Than The Former. These He Bestowed Sparingly, Without Partiality, And Frequently Even On Common Soldiers. He Presented M. Agrippa, After The Naval Engagement In The Sicilian War, With A Sea-green Banner. Those Who Shared In The Honours Of A Triumph, Although They Had Attended Him In His Expeditions, And Taken Part In His Victories, He Judged It Improper To Distinguish By The Usual Rewards For Service, Because They Had A Right Themselves To Grant Such Rewards To Whom They Pleased. He Thought Nothing More Derogatory To The Character Of An Accomplished General Than Precipitancy And Rashness; On Which Account He Had Frequently In His Mouth Those Proverbs:</a> <span class="flex">190</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="192">Xxvi. He Was Advanced To Public Offices Before The Age At Which He Was Legally Qualified For Them; And To Some, Also, Of A New Kind, And For Life. He Seized The Consulship In The Twentieth Year Of His Age, Quartering His Legions In A Threatening Manner Near The City, And Sending Deputies To Demand It For Him In The Name Of The Army. When The Senate Demurred,  A Centurion, Named Cornelius, Who Was At The Head Of The Chief Deputation, Throwing Back His Cloak, And Shewing The Hilt Of His Sword, Had The Presumption To Say In The Senate-house, “This Will Make Him Consul, If Ye Will Not.” His Second Consulship He Filled Nine Years Afterwards; His Third, After The Interval Of Only One Year, And Held The Same Office Every Year Successively Until The Eleventh. From This Period, Although The Consulship Was Frequently Offered Him, He Always Declined It, Until, After A Long Interval, Not Less Than Seventeen Years, He Voluntarily Stood For The Twelfth, And Two Years After That, For A Thirteenth; That He Might Successively Introduce Into The Forum, On Their Entering Public Life, His Two Sons, Caius And Lucius, While He Was Invested With The Highest Office In The State. In His Five Consulships From The Sixth To The Eleventh, He Continued In Office Throughout The Year; But In The Rest, During Only Nine, Six, Four, Or Three Months, And In His Second No More Than A Few Hours. For Having Sat For A Short Time In The Morning, Upon The Calends Of January [1St January], In His Curule Chair , Before The Temple Of Jupiter Capitolinus, He Abdicated The Office, And Substituted Another In His Room. Nor Did He Enter Upon Them All At Rome, But Upon The Fourth In Asia, The Fifth In The Isle Of Samos, And The Eighth And Ninth At Tarragona.</a> <span class="flex">192</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="193">Xxvii. During Ten Years He Acted As One Of The Triumvirate For Settling The Commonwealth, In Which Office He For Some Time Opposed His Colleagues In Their Design Of A Proscription; But After It Was Begun, He Prosecuted It With More Determined Rigour Than Either Of Them. For Whilst They Were Often Prevailed Upon, By The Interest And Intercession Of Friends, To Shew Mercy, He Alone Strongly Insisted That No One Should Be Spared, And Even Proscribed Caius Toranius , His Guardian; Who Had  Been Formerly The Colleague Of His Father Octavius In The Aedileship. Junius Saturnius Adds This Farther Account Of Him: That When, After The Proscription Was Over, Marcus Lepidus Made An Apology In The Senate For Their Past Proceedings, And Gave Them Hopes Of A More Mild Administration For The Future, Because They Had Now Sufficiently Crushed Their Enemies; He, On The Other Hand, Declared That The Only Limit He Had Fixed To The Proscription Was, That He Should Be Free To Act As He Pleased. Afterwards, However, Repenting Of His Severity, He Advanced T. Vinius Philopoemen To The Equestrian Rank, For Having Concealed His Patron At The Time He Was Proscribed. In This Same Office He Incurred Great Odium Upon Many Accounts. For As He Was One Day Making An Harangue, Observing Among The Soldiers Pinarius, A Roman Knight, Admit Some Private Citizens, And Engaged In Taking Notes, He Ordered Him To Be Stabbed Before His Eyes, As A Busy-body And A Spy Upon Him. He So Terrified With His Menaces Tedius Afer, The Consul Elect , For Having Reflected Upon Some Action Of His, That He Threw Himself From A Great Height, And Died On The Spot. And When Quintus Gallius, The Praetor, Came To Compliment Him With A Double Tablet Under His Cloak, Suspecting That It Was A Sword He Had Concealed, And Yet Not Venturing To Make A Search, Lest It Should Be Found To Be Something Else, He Caused Him To Be Dragged From His Tribunal By Centurions And Soldiers, And Tortured Like A Slave: And Although He Made No Confession, Ordered Him To Be Put To Death, After He Had, With His Own Hands, Plucked Out His Eyes. His Own Account Of The Matter, However, Is, That Quintus Gallius Sought A Private Conference With Him, For The Purpose Of Assassinating Him; That He Therefore Put Him In Prison, But Afterwards Released Him, And Banished Him The City; When He Perished Either In A Storm At Sea, Or By Falling Into The Hands Of Robbers.</a> <span class="flex">193</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="195">Xxviii. He Twice Entertained Thoughts Of Restoring The Republic ; First, Immediately After He Had Crushed Antony, Remembering That He Had Often Charged Him With Being The Obstacle To Its Restoration. The Second Time Was In Consequence Of A Long Illness, When He Sent For The Magistrates And The Senate To His Own House, And Delivered Them A Particular Account Of The State Of The Empire. But Reflecting At The Same Time That It Would Be Both Hazardous To Himself To Return To The Condition Of A Private Person, And Might Be Dangerous To The Public To Have The Government Placed Again Under The Control Of The People, He Resolved To Keep It In His Own Hands, Whether With The Better Event Or Intention, Is Hard To Say. His Good Intentions He Often Affirmed In Private Discourse, And Also Published An Edict, In Which It Was Declared In The Following Terms: “May It Be Permitted Me To Have The Happiness Of Establishing The Commonwealth On A Safe And Sound Basis, And Thus Enjoy The Reward Of Which I Am Ambitious, That Of Being Celebrated For Moulding It Into The Form Best Adapted To Present Circumstances; So That, On My Leaving The World, I May Carry With Me The Hope That The Foundations Which I Have Laid For Its Future Government, Will Stand Firm And Stable.”</a> <span class="flex">195</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="196">Xxix. The City, Which Was Not Built In A Manner Suitable To The Grandeur Of The Empire, And Was Liable To Inundations Of The Tiber , As Well As To Fires, Was So Much Improved Under His Administration, That He Boasted, Not Without Reason, That He “Found It Of Brick, But Left It Of Marble.”  He Also Rendered  Used Frequently There To Hold The Senate, And Examine The Rolls Of The Judges.</a> <span class="flex">196</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="200">Xxxi. The Office Of Pontifex Maximus, Of Which He Could  Not Decently Deprive Lepidus As Long As He Lived , He Assumed As Soon As He Was Dead. He Then Caused All Prophetical Books, Both In Latin And Greek, The Authors Of Which Were Either Unknown, Or Of No Great Authority, To Be Brought In; And The Whole Collection, Amounting To Upwards Of Two Thousand Volumes, He Committed To The Flames, Preserving Only The Sibylline Oracles; But Not Even Those Without A Strict Examination, To Ascertain Which Were Genuine. This Being Done, He Deposited Them In Two Gilt Coffers, Under The Pedestal Of The Statue Of The Palatine Apollo. He Restored The Calendar, Which Had Been Corrected By Julius Caesar, But Through Negligence Was Again Fallen Into Confusion , To Its Former Regularity; And Upon That Occasion, Called The Month Sextilis , By His Own Name, August, Rather Than September, In Which He Was Born; Because In It He Had Obtained His First Consulship, And All His Most Considerable Victories . He Increased The Number, Dignity, And Revenues Of The Priests, And Especially Those Of The Vestal Virgins. And When, Upon The Death Of One Of Them, A New One Was To Be Taken , And Many Persons Made Interest That Their Daughters’ Names Might Be Omitted In The Lists For Election, He Replied With An Oath, “If Either Of My Own Grand-daughters Were Old Enough, I Would Have Proposed Her.”</a> <span class="flex">200</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="203">Xxxii. He Corrected Many Ill Practices, Which, To The Detriment Of The Public, Had Either Survived The Licentious Habits Of The Late Civil Wars, Or Else Originated In The Long Peace. Bands Of Robbers Showed Themselves Openly, Completely Armed, Under Colour Of Self-defence; And In Different Parts Of The Country, Travellers, Freemen And Slaves Without Distinction, Were Forcibly Carried Off, And Kept To Work In The Houses Of Correction . Several Associations Were Formed Under The Specious  Name Of A New College, Which Banded Together For The Perpetration Of All Kinds Of Villany. The Banditti He Quelled By Establishing Posts Of Soldiers In Suitable Stations For The Purpose; The Houses Of Correction Were Subjected To A Strict Superintendence; All Associations, Those Only Excepted Which Were Of Ancient Standing, And Recognised By The Laws, Were Dissolved. He Burnt All The Notes Of Those Who Had Been A Long Time In Arrear With The Treasury, As Being The Principal Source Of Vexatious Suits And Prosecutions. Places In The City Claimed By The Public, Where The Right Was Doubtful, He Adjudged To The Actual Possessors. He Struck Out Of The List Of Criminals The Names Of Those Over Whom Prosecutions Had Been Long Impending, Where Nothing Further Was Intended By The Informers Than To Gratify Their Own Malice, By Seeing Their Enemies Humiliated; Laying It Down As A Rule, That If Any One Chose To Renew A Prosecution, He Should Incur The Risk Of The Punishment Which He Sought To Inflict. And That Crimes Might Not Escape Punishment, Nor Business Be Neglected By Delay, He Ordered The Courts To Sit During The Thirty Days Which Were Spent In Celebrating Honorary Games. To The Three Classes Of Judges Then Existing, He Added A Fourth, Consisting Of Persons Of Inferior Order, Who Were Called Ducenarii, And Decided All Litigations About Trifling Sums. He Chose Judges From The Age Of Thirty Years And Upwards; That Is Five Years Younger Than Had Been Usual Before. And A Great Many Declining The Office, He Was With Much Difficulty Prevailed Upon To Allow Each Class Of Judges A Twelve-month’s Vacation In Turn; And The Courts To Be Shut During The Months Of November And December.</a> <span class="flex">203</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="204">Xxxiii. He Was Himself Assiduous In His Functions As A Judge, And Would Sometimes Prolong His Sittings Even Into The Night : If He Were Indisposed, His Litter Was Placed Before  The Tribunal, Or He Administered Justice Reclining On His Couch At Home; Displaying Always Not Only The Greatest Attention, But Extreme Lenity. To Save A Culprit, Who Evidently Appeared Guilty Of Parricide, From The Extreme Penalty Of Being Sewn Up In A Sack, Because None Were Punished In That Manner But Such As Confessed The Fact, He Is Said To Have Interrogated Him Thus: “Surely You Did Not Kill Your Father, Did You?” And When, In A Trial Of A Cause About A Forged Will, All Those Who Had Signed It Were Liable To The Penalty Of The Cornelian Law, He Ordered That His Colleagues On The Tribunal Should Not Only Be Furnished With The Two Tablets By Which They Decided, “Guilty Or Not Guilty,” But With A Third Likewise, Ignoring The Offence Of Those Who Should Appear To Have Given Their Signatures Through Any Deception Or Mistake. All Appeals In Causes Between Inhabitants Of Rome, He Assigned Every Year To The Praetor Of The City; And Where Provincials Were Concerned, To Men Of Consular Rank, To One Of Whom The Business Of Each Province Was Referred.</a> <span class="flex">204</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="205">Xxxiv. Some Laws He Abrogated, And He Made Some New Ones; Such As The Sumptuary Law, That Relating To Adultery And The Violation Of Chastity, The Law Against Bribery In Elections, And Likewise That For The Encouragement Of Marriage. Having Been More Severe In His Reform Of This Law Than The Rest, He Found The People Utterly Averse To Submit To It, Unless The Penalties Were Abolished Or Mitigated, Besides Allowing An Interval Of Three Years After A Wife’s Death, And Increasing The Premiums On Marriage. The Equestrian Order Clamoured Loudly, At A Spectacle In The Theatre, For Its Total Repeal; Whereupon He Sent For The Children Of Germanicus, And Shewed Them Partly Sitting Upon His Own Lap, And Partly On Their Father’s; Intimating By His Looks And Gestures, That They Ought Not To Think It A Grievance To Follow The Example Of That Young Man. But Finding That The Force Of The Law Was Eluded, By Marrying Girls Under The Age Of Puberty, And By Frequent Change Of Wives, He Limited The Time For Consummation After Espousals, And Imposed Restrictions On Divorce.</a> <span class="flex">205</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="206">Xxxv. By Two Separate Scrutinies He Reduced To Their Former Number And Splendour The Senate, Which Had Been Swamped By A Disorderly Crowd; For They Were Now More Than A  Months A New Council, With Whom He Might Consult Previously Upon Such Affairs As He Judged Proper At Any Time To Lay Before The Full Senate. He Also Took The Votes Of The Senators Upon Any Subject Of Importance, Not According To Custom, Nor In Regular Order, But As He Pleased; That Every One Might Hold Himself Ready To Give His Opinion, Rather Than A Mere Vote Of Assent.</a> <span class="flex">206</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="207">Xxxvi. He Also Made Several Other Alterations In The Management Of Public Affairs, Among Which Were These Following: That The Acts Of The Senate Should Not Be Published ; That The Magistrates Should Not Be Sent Into The Provinces Immediately After The Expiration Of Their Office; That The Proconsuls Should Have A Certain Sum Assigned Them Out Of The Treasury For Mules And Tents, Which Used Before To Be Contracted For By The Government With Private Persons; That The Management Of The Treasury Should Be Transferred From The City-quaestors To The Praetors, Or Those Who Had Already Served In The Latter Office; And That The Decemviri Should Call Together The Court Of One Hundred, Which Had Been Formerly Summoned By Those Who Had Filled The Office Of Quaestor.</a> <span class="flex">207</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="208">Xxxvii. To Augment The Number Of Persons Employed In The Administration Of The State, He Devised Several New Offices; Such As Surveyors Of The Public Buildings, Of The Roads, The Aqueducts, And The Bed Of The Tiber; For The Distribution Of Corn To The People; The Praefecture Of The City; A Triumvirate For The Election Of The Senators; And Another For Inspecting The Several Troops Of The Equestrian Order, As Often As It Was Necessary. He Revived The Office Of Censor , Which Had Been Long Disused, And Increased The Number Of Praetors. He Likewise Required That Whenever The Consulship Was Conferred On Him, He Should Have Two Colleagues Instead Of One; But His Proposal  Was Rejected, All The Senators Declaring By Acclamation That He Abated His High Majesty Quite Enough In Not Filling The Office Alone, And Consenting To Share It With Another.</a> <span class="flex">208</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="209">Xxxviii. He Was Unsparing In The Reward Of Military Merit, Having Granted To Above Thirty Generals The Honour Of The Greater Triumph; Besides Which, He Took Care To Have Triamphal Decorations Voted By The Senate For More Than That Number. That The Sons Of Senators Might Become Early Acquainted With The Administration Of Affairs, He Permitted Them, At The Age When They Took The Garb Of Manhood , To Assume Also The Distinction Of The Senatorian Robe, With Its Broad Border, And To Be Present At The Debates In The Senate-house. When They Entered The Military Service, He Not Only Gave Them The Rank Of Military Tribunes In The Legions, But Likewise The Command Of The Auxiliary Horse. And That All Might Have An Opportunity Of Acquiring Military Experience, He Commonly Joined Two Sons Of Senators In Command Of Each Troop Of Horse. He Frequently Reviewed The Troops Of The Equestrian Order, Reviving The Ancient Custom Of A Cavalcade , Which Had Been Long Laid Aside. But He Did Not Suffer Any One To Be Obliged By An Accuser To Dismount While He Passed In Review, As Had Formerly Been The Practice. As For Such As Were Infirm With Age, Or  Any Way Deformed, He Allowed Them To Send Their Horses Before Them, Coming On Foot To Answer To Their Names, When The Muster Roll Was Called Over Soon Afterwards. He Permitted Those Who Had Attained The Age Of Thirty-five Years, And Desired Not To Keep Their Horse Any Longer, To Have The Privilege Of Giving It Up.</a> <span class="flex">209</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="210">Xxxix. With The Assistance Of Ten Senators, He Obliged Each Of The Roman Knights To Give An Account Of His Life: In Regard To Those Who Fell Under His Displeasure, Some Were Punished; Others Had A Mark Of Infamy Set Against Their Names. The Most Part He Only Reprimanded, But Not In The Same Terms. The Mildest Mode Of Reproof Was By Delivering Them Tablets , The Contents Of Which, Confined To Themselves, They Were To Read On The Spot. Some He Disgraced For Borrowing Money At Low Interest, And Letting It Out Again Upon Usurious Profit.</a> <span class="flex">210</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="211">Xl. In The Election Of Tribunes Of The People, If There Was Not A Sufficient Number Of Senatorian Candidates, He Nominated Others From The Equestrian Order; Granting Them The Liberty, After The Expiration Of Their Office, To Continue In Whichsoever Of The Two Orders They Pleased. As Most Of The Knights Had Been Much Reduced In Their Estates By The Civil Wars, And Therefore Durst Not Sit To See The Public Games In The Theatre In The Seats Allotted To Their Order, For Fear Of The Penalty Provided By The Law In That Case, He Enacted, That None Were Liable To It, Who Had Themselves, Or Whose Parents Had Ever, Possessed A Knight’s Estate. He Took The Census Of The Roman People Street By Street: And That The People Might Not Be Too Often Taken From Their Business To Receive The Distribution Of Corn, It Was His Intention To Deliver Tickets Three Times A Year For Four Months Respectively; But At Their Request, He Continued The Former Regulation, That They Should Receive Their  Share Monthly. He Revived The Former Law Of Elections, Endeavouring, By Various Penalties, To Suppress The Practice Of Bribery. Upon The Day Of Election, He Distributed To The Freemen Of The Fabian And Scaptian Tribes, In Which He Himself Was Enrolled, A Thousand Sesterces Each, That They Might Look For Nothing From Any Of The Candidates. Considering It Of Extreme Importance To Preserve The Roman People Pure, And Untainted With A Mixture Of Foreign Or Servile Blood, He Not Only Bestowed The Freedom Of The City With A Sparing Hand, But Laid Some Restriction Upon The Practice Of Manumitting Slaves. When Tiberius Interceded With Him For The Freedom Of Rome In Behalf Of A Greek Client Of His, He Wrote To Him For Answer, “I Shall Not Grant It, Unless He Comes Himself, And Satisfies Me That He Has Just Grounds For The Application.” And When Livia Begged The Freedom Of The City For A Tributary Gaul, He Refused It, But Offered To Release Him From Payment Of Taxes, Saying, “I Shall Sooner Suffer Some Loss In My Exchequer, Than That The Citizenship Of Rome Be Rendered Too Common.” Not Content With Interposing Many Obstacles To Either The Partial Or Complete Emancipation Of Slaves, By Quibbles Respecting The Number, Condition And Difference Of Those Who Were To Be Manumitted; He Likewise Enacted That None Who Had Been Put In Chains Or Tortured, Should Ever Obtain The Freedom Of The City In Any Degree. He Endeavoured Also To Restore The Old Habit And Dress Of The Romans; And Upon Seeing Once, In An Assembly Of The People, A Crowd In Grey Cloaks , He Exclaimed With Indignation, “See There,</a> <span class="flex">211</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="214">Xlii. But To Show That He Was A Prince Who Regarded More The Good Of His People Than Their Applause, He Reprimanded Them Very Severely, Upon Their Complaining Of The Scarcity And Dearness Of Wine. “My Son-in-law, Agrippa,” He Said, “Has Sufficiently Provided For Quenching Your Thirst, By The Great Plenty Of Water With Which He Has Supplied The Town.” Upon Their Demanding A Gift Which He Had Promised Them, He Said, “I Am A Man Of My Word.” But Upon Their Importuning Him For One Which He Had Not Promised, He Issued A Proclamation Upbraiding Them For Their Scandalous Impudence; At The Same Time Telling Them, “I Shall Now Give You Nothing, Whatever I May Have Intended To Do.” With The Same Strict Firmness, When, Upon A Promise He Had Made Of A Donative, He Found Many Slaves Had Been Emancipated And Enrolled Amongst The Citizens, He Declared That No One Should Receive Anything Who Was Not Included In The Promise, And He Gave The Rest Less Than He Had Promised Them, In Order That The Amount He Had Set Apart Might Hold Out. On One Occasion, In A Season Of Great Scarcity, Which It Was Difficult To Remedy, He Ordered Out Of The City The Troops Of Slaves Brought For Sale, The Gladiators  Belonging To The Masters Of Defence, And All Foreigners, Excepting Physicians And The Teachers Of The Liberal Sciences. Part Of The Domestic Slaves Were Likewise Ordered To Be Dismissed. When, At Last, Plenty Was Restored, He Writes Thus “I Was Much Inclined To Abolish For Ever The Practice Of Allowing The People Corn At The Public Expense, Because They Trust So Much To It, That They Are Too Lazy To Till Their Lands; But I Did Not Persevere In My Design, As I Felt Sure That The Practice Would Some Time Or Other Be Revived By Some One Ambitious Of Popular Favour.” However, He So Managed The Affair Ever Afterwards, That As Much Account Was Taken Of Husbandmen And Traders, As Of The Idle Populace.</a> <span class="flex">214</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="215">Xliii. In The Number, Variety, And Magnificence Of His Public Spectacles, He Surpassed All Former Example. Four-and-twenty Times, He Says, He Treated The People With Games Upon His Own Account, And Three-and-twenty Times For Such Magistrates As Were Either Absent, Or Not Able To Afford The Expense. The Performances Took Place Sometimes In The Different Streets Of The City, And Upon Several Stages, By Players In All Languages. The Same He Did Not Only In The Forum And Amphitheatre, But In The Circus Likewise, And In The Septa : And Sometimes He Exhibited Only The Hunting Of Wild Beasts. He Entertained The People With Wrestlers In The Campus Martius, Where Wooden Seats Were Erected For The Purpose; And Also With A Naval Fight, For Which He Excavated The Ground Near The Tiber, Where There Is Now The Grove Of The Caesars. During These Two Entertainments He Stationed Guards In The City, Lest, By Robbers Taking Advantage Of The Small Number Of People Left At Home, It Might Be Exposed To Depredations. In The Circus He Exhibited Chariot And Foot Races, And Combats With Wild Beasts, In Which The Performers Were Often Youths Of The Highest Rank. His Favourite Spectacle Was The Trojan Game, Acted By A Select Number Of Boys, In Parties Differing In Age And Station; Thinking  That It Was A Practice Both Excellent In Itself, And Sanctioned By Ancient Usage, That The Spirit Of The Young Nobles Should Be Displayed In Such Exercises. Caius Nonius Asprenas, Who Was Lamed By A Fall In This Diversion, He Presented With A Gold Collar, And Allowed Him And His Posterity To Bear The Surname Of Torquati. But Soon Afterwards He Gave Up The Exhibition Of This Game, In Consequence Of A Severe And Bitter Speech Made In The Senate By Asinius Pollio, The Orator, In Which He Complained Bitterly Of The Misfortune Of Aeserninus, His Grandson, Who Likewise Broke His Leg In The Same Diversion.</a> <span class="flex">215</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="218">Xliv. He Corrected The Confusion And Disorder With Which The Spectators Took Their Seats At The Public Games, After An Affront Which Was Offered To A Senator At Puteoli, For Whom, In A Crowded Theatre, No One Would Make Room. He Therefore Procured A Decree Of The Senate, That In All Public Spectacles Of Any Sort, And In Any Place Whatever, The First Tier Of Benches Should Be Left Empty For The Accommodation Of Senators. He Would Not Even Permit The Ambassadors Of Free Nations, Nor Of Those Which Were Allies Of Rome, To Sit In The Orchestra; Having Found That Some Manumitted Slaves Had Been Sent Under That Character. He Separated The Soldiery From The Rest Of The People, And Assigned To Married Plebeians Their Particular Rows Of Seats. To The Boys He Assigned Their Own Benches, And To Their Tutors The Seats Which Were Nearest It; Ordering That None Clothed In Black Should Sit In The Centre Of The Circle . Nor Would He Allow Any Women To Witness The Combats Of Gladiators, Except From The Upper Part Of The Theatre, Although They Formerly Used To Take Their Places Promiscuously With The Rest Of The Spectators. To The Vestal Virgins He Granted Seats In The Theatre, Reserved For Them Only, Opposite The Praetor’s Bench. He Excluded, However, The Whole Female Sex From Seeing The Wrestlers: So That In The Games Which He Exhibited Upon His Accession To The Office Of High-priest, He Deferred Producing A Pair Of Combatants Which The People Called For, Until The Next Morning; And Intimated By Proclamation, “His Pleasure That No Woman Should Appear In The Theatre Before Five O’clock.”</a> <span class="flex">218</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="219">Xlv. He Generally Viewed The Circensian Games Himself, From The Upper Rooms Of The Houses Of His Friends Or Freedmen; Sometimes From The Place Appointed For The Statues Of The Gods, And Sitting In Company With His Wife And Children. He  Occasionally Absented Himself From The Spectacles For Several Hours, And Sometimes For Whole Days; But Not Without First Making An Apology, And Appointing Substitutes To Preside In His Stead. When Present, He Never Attended To Anything Else Either To Avoid The Reflections Which He Used To Say Were Commonly Made Upon His Father, Caesar, For Perusing Letters And Memorials, And Making Rescripts During The Spectacles; Or From The Real Pleasure He Took In Attending Those Exhibitions; Of Which He Made No Secret, He Often Candidly Owning It. This He Manifested Frequently By Presenting Honorary Crowns And Handsome Rewards To The Best Performers, In The Games Exhibited By Others; And He Never Was Present At Any Performance Of The Greeks, Without Rewarding The Most Deserving, According To Their Merit. He Took Particular Pleasure In Witnessing Pugilistic Contests, Especially Those Of The Latins, Not Only Between Combatants Who Had Been Trained Scientifically, Whom He Used Often To Match With The Greek Champions; But Even Between Mobs Of The Lower Classes Fighting In Streets, And Tilting At Random, Without Any Knowledge Of The Art. In Short, He Honoured With His Patronage All Sorts Of People Who Contributed In Any Way To The Success Of The Public Entertainments. He Not Only Maintained, But Enlarged, The Privileges Of The Wrestlers. He Prohibited Combats Of Gladiators Where No Quarter Was Given. He Deprived The Magistrates Of The Power Of Correcting The Stage-players, Which By An Ancient Law Was Allowed Them At All Times, And In All Places; Restricting Their Jurisdiction Entirely To The Time Of Performance And Misdemeanours In The Theatres. He Would, However, Admit, Of No Abatement, And Exacted With The Utmost Rigour The Greatest Exertions Of The Wrestlers And Gladiators In Their Several Encounters. He Went So Far In Restraining The Licentiousness Of Stage-players, That Upon Discovering That Stephanio, A Performer Of The Highest Class, Had A Married Woman With Her Hair Cropped, And Dressed In Boy’s Clothes, To Wait Upon Him At Table, He Ordered Him To Be Whipped Through All The Three Theatres, And Then Banished Him. Hylas, An Actor Of Pantomimes, Upon A Complaint Against Him By The Praetor, He Commanded To Be Scourged In The Court Of His Own House, Which, However, Was Open To The Public. And Pylades He Not Only Banished From The City, But From Italy Also, For Pointing With His Finger At A Spectator By Whom He Was Hissed, And Turning The Eyes Of The Audience Upon Him.</a> <span class="flex">219</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="222">Xlvii. The More Important Provinces, Which Could Not With Ease Or Safety Be Entrusted To The Government Of Annual Magistrates, He Reserved For His Own Administration: The Rest He Distributed By Lot Amongst The Proconsuls: But Sometimes He Made Exchanges, And Frequently Visited Most Of Both Kinds In Person. Some Cities In Alliance With Rome, But Which By Their Great Licentiousness Were Hastening To Ruin, He Deprived Of Their Independence. Others, Which Were Much In Debt, He Relieved, And Rebuilt Such As Had Been Destroyed By Earthquakes. To Those That Could Produce Any Instance Of Their Having Deserved Well Of The Roman People, He Presented The Freedom Of Latium, Or Even That Of The City. There Is Not, I Believe, A Province, Except Africa And Sardinia, Which He Did Not Visit. After Forcing Sextus Pompeius To Take Refuge In Those Provinces, He Was Indeed Preparing To Cross Over From Sicily To Them, But Was Prevented By Continual And Violent Storms, And Afterwards There Was No Occasion Or Call For Such A Voyage.</a> <span class="flex">222</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="223">Xlviii. Kingdoms, Of Which He Had Made Himself Master By The Right Of Conquest, A Few Only Excepted, He Either Restored To Their Former Possessors , Or Conferred Upon Aliens. Between  Kings Of Alliance With Rome, He Encouraged Most Intimate Union; Being Always Ready To Promote Or Favour Any Proposal Of Marriage Or Friendship Amongst Them; And, Indeed, Treated Them All With The Same Consideration, As If They Were Members And Parts Of The Empire. To Such Of Them As Were Minors Or Lunatics He Appointed Guardians, Until They Arrived At Age, Or Recovered Their Senses; And The Sons Of Many Of Them He Brought Up And Educated With His Own.</a> <span class="flex">223</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="224">Xlix. With Respect To The Army, He Distributed The Legions And Auxiliary Troops Throughout The Several Provinces, He Stationed A Fleet At Misenum, And Another At Ravenna, For The Protection Of The Upper And Lower Seas . A Certain Number Of The Forces Were Selected, To Occupy The Posts In The City, And Partly For His Own Body-guard; But He Dismissed The Spanish Guard, Which He Retained About Him Till The Fall Of Antony; And Also The Germans, Whom He Had Amongst His Guards, Until The Defeat Of Varus. Yet He Never Permitted A Greater Force Than Three Cohorts In The City, And Had No  Camps . The Rest He Quartered In The Neighbourhood Of The Nearest Towns, In Winter And Summer Camps. All The Troops Throughout The Empire He Reduced To One Fixed Model With Regard To Their Pay And Their Pensions; Determining These According To Their Rank In The Army, The Time They Had Served, And Their Private Means; So That After Their Discharge, They Might Not Be Tempted By Age Or Necessities To Join The Agitators For A Revolution. For The Purpose Of Providing A Fund Always Ready To Meet Their Pay And Pensions, He Instituted A Military Exchequer, And Appropriated New Taxes To That Object. In Order To Obtain The Earliest Intelligence Of What Was Passing In The Provinces, He Established Posts, Consisting At First Of Young Men Stationed At Moderate Distances Along The Military Roads, And Afterwards Of Regular Couriers With Fast Vehicles; Which Appeared To Him The Most Commodious, Because The Persons Who Were The Bearers Of Dispatches, Written On The Spot, Might Then Be Questioned About The Business, As Occasion Occurred.</a> <span class="flex">224</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="225">L. In Sealing Letters-patent, Rescripts, Or Epistles, He At First Used The Figure Of A Sphinx, Afterwards The Head Of Alexander  The Great, And At Last His Own, Engraved By The Hand Of Dioscorides; Which Practice Was Retained By The Succeeding Emperors. He Was Extremely Precise In Dating His Letters, Putting Down Exactly The Time Of The Day Or Night At Which They Were Dispatched.</a> <span class="flex">225</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="226">Li. Of His Clemency And Moderation There Are Abundant And Signal Instances. For, Not To Enumerate How Many And What Persons Of The Adverse Party He Pardoned, Received Into Favour, And Suffered To Rise To The Highest Eminence In The State; He Thought It Sufficient To Punish Junius Novatus And Cassius Patavinus, Who Were Both Plebeians, One Of Them With A Fine, And The Other With An Easy Banishment; Although The Former Had Published, In The Name Of Young Agrippa, A Very Scurrilous Letter Against Him, And The Other Declared Openly, At An Entertainment Where There Was A Great Deal Of Company, “That He Neither Wanted Inclination Nor Courage To Stab Him.” In The Trial Of Aemilius Aelianus, Of Cordova, When, Among Other Charges Exhibited Against Him, It Was Particularly Insisted Upon, That He Used To Calumniate Caesar, He Turned Round To The Accuser, And Said, With An Air And Tone Of Passion, “I Wish You Could Make That Appear; I Shall Let Aelianus Know That I Have A Tongue Too, And Shall Speak Sharper Of Him Than He Ever Did Of Me.” Nor Did He, Either Then Or Afterwards, Make Any Farther Inquiry Into The Affair. And When Tiberius, In A Letter, Complained Of The Affront With Great Earnestness, He Returned Him An Answer In The Following Terms: “Do Not, My Dear Tiberius, Give Way To The Ardour Of Youth In This Affair; Nor Be So Indignant That Any Person Should Speak Ill Of Me. It Is Enough, For Us, If We Can Prevent Any One From Really Doing Us Mischief.”</a> <span class="flex">226</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="227">Lii. Although He Knew That It Had Been Customary To Decree Temples In Honour Of The Proconsuls, Yet He Would Not Permit Them To Be Erected In Any Of The Provinces, Unless In The Joint Names Of Himself And Rome. Within The Limits Of The City, He Positively Refused Any Honour Of That Kind. He Melted Down All The Silver Statues Which Had Been Erected To Him, And Converted The Whole Into Tripods, Which He Consecrated To The Palatine Apollo. And When The People Importuned Him To Accept The Dictatorship, He Bent Down On One Knee, With His Toga Thrown Over His Shoulders, And His Breast Exposed To View, Begging To Be Excused.</a> <span class="flex">227</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="231">Liv. On His Speaking In The Senate, He Has Been Told By  One Of The Members, “I Did Not Understand You,” And By Another, “I Would Contradict You, Could I Do It With Safety.” And Sometimes, Upon His Being So Much Offended At The Heat With Which The Debates Were Conducted In The Senate, As To Quit The House In Anger, Some Of The Members Have Repeatedly Exclaimed: “Surely, The Senators Ought To Have Liberty Of Speech On Matters Of Government.” Antistius Labeo, In The Election Of A New Senate, When Each, As He Was Named, Chose Another, Nominated Marcus Lepidus, Who Had Formerly Been Augustus’s Enemy, And Was Then In Banishment; And Being Asked By The Latter, “Is There No Other Person More Deserving?” He Replied, “Every Man Has His Own Opinion.” Nor Was Any One Ever Molested For His Freedom Of Speech, Although It Was Carried To The Extent Of Insolence.</a> <span class="flex">231</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="232">Lv. Even When Some Infamous Libels Against Him Were Dispersed In The Senate-house, He Was Neither Disturbed, Nor Did He Give Himself Much Trouble To Refute Them. He Would Not So Much As Order An Enquiry To Be Made After The Authors; But Only Proposed, That, For The Future, Those Who Published Libels Or Lampoons, In A Borrowed Name, Against Any Person, Should Be Called To Account.</a> <span class="flex">232</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="233">Lvi. Being Provoked By Some Petulant Jests, Which Were Designed To Render Him Odious, He Answered Them By A Proclamation; And Yet He Prevented The Senate From Passing An Act, To Restrain The Liberties Which Were Taken With Others In People’s Wills. Whenever He Attended At The Election Of Magistrates, He Went Round The Tribes, With The Candidates Of His Nomination, And Begged The Votes Of The People In The Usual Manner. He Likewise Gave His Own Vote In His Tribe, As One Of The People. He Suffered Himself To Be Summoned As A Witness Upon Trials, And Not Only To Be Questioned, But To Be Cross-examined, With The Utmost Patience. In Building His Forum, He Restricted Himself In The Site, Not Presuming To Compel The Owners Of The Neighbouring Houses To Give Up Their Property. He Never Recommended His Sons To The People, Without Adding These Words, “If They Deserve It.” And Upon The Audience Rising On Their Entering The Theatre, While They Were Yet Minors, And Giving Them Applause In A Standing Position, He Made It A Matter Of Serious Complaint.</a> <span class="flex">233</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="236">Lvii. How Much He Was Beloved For His Worthy Conduct In All These Respects, It Is Easy To Imagine. I Say Nothing Of The Decrees Of The Senate In His Honour, Which May Seem To Have Resulted From Compulsion Or Deference. The Roman Knights Voluntarily, And With One Accord, Always Celebrated His Birth For Two Days Together; And All Ranks Of The People, Yearly, In Performance Of A Vow They Had Made, Threw A Piece Of Money Into The Curtian Lake , As An Offering For His Welfare. They Likewise, On The Calends [First] Of January, Presented For His Acceptance New-year’s Gifts In The Capitol, Though He Was Not Present With Which Donations He Purchased Some Costly Images Of The Gods, Which He Erected In Several Streets Of The City; As That Of Apollo Sandaliarius, Jupiter Tragoedus , And Others. When His House On The Palatine Hill Was Accidentally Destroyed By Fire, The Veteran Soldiers, The Judges, The Tribes, And Even The People, Individually, Contributed, According To The Ability Of Each, For Rebuilding It; But He Would  Accept Only Of Some Small Portion Out Of The Several Sums Collected, And Refused To Take From Any One Person More Than A Single Denarius . Upon His Return Home From Any Of The Provinces, They Attended Him Not Only With Joyful Acclamations, But With Songs. It Is Also Remarked, That As Often As He Entered The City, The Infliction Of Punishment Was Suspended For The Time.</a> <span class="flex">236</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="237">Lviii. The Whole Body Of The People, Upon A Sudden Impulse, And With Unanimous Consent, Offered Him The Title Of Father Of His Country. It Was Announced To Him First At Antium, By A Deputation From The People, And Upon His Declining The Honour, They Repeated Their Offer On His Return To Rome, In A Full Theatre, When They Were Crowned With Laurel. The Senate Soon Afterwards Adopted The Proposal, Not In The Way Of Acclamation Or Decree, But By Commissioning M. Messala, In An Unanimous Vote, To Compliment Him With It In The Following Terms: “With Hearty Wishes For The Happiness And Prosperity Of Yourself And Your Family, Caesar Augustus,  Gods, But The Continuance Of This Your Affection For Me To The Last Moments Of My Life?”</a> <span class="flex">237</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="238">Lix. To The Physician Antonius Musa , Who Had Cured Him Of A Dangerous Illness, They Erected A Statue Near That Of Aesculapius, By A General Subscription. Some Heads Of Families Ordered In Their Wills, That Their Heirs Should Lead Victims To The Capitol, With A Tablet Carried Before Them, And Pay Their Vows, “Because Augustus Still Survived.” Some Italian Cities Appointed The Day Upon Which He First Visited Them, To Be Thenceforth The Beginning Of Their Year. And Most Of The Provinces, Besides Erecting Temples And Altars, Instituted Games, To Be Celebrated To His Honour, In Most Towns, Every Five Years.</a> <span class="flex">238</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="239">Lx. The Kings, His Friends And Allies, Built Cities In Their Respective Kingdoms, To Which They Gave The Name Of Caesarea; And All With One Consent Resolved To Finish, At Their Common Expense, The Temple Of Jupiter Olympius, At Athens, Which Had Been Begun Long Before, And Consecrate It To His Genius. They Frequently Also Left Their Kingdoms, Laid Aside The Badges Of Royalty, And Assuming The Toga, Attended And Paid Their Respects To Him Daily, In The Manner Of Clients To Their Patrons; Not Only At Rome, But When He Was Travelling Through The Provinces.</a> <span class="flex">239</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="240">Lxi. Having Thus Given An Account Of The Manner In Which He Filled His Public Offices Both Civil And Military, And His Conduct In The Government Of The Empire, Both In Peace And War; I Shall Now Describe His Private And Domestic Life, His Habits At Home And Among His Friends And Dependents, And The Fortune Attending Him In Those Scenes Of Retirement, From His Youth To The Day Of His Death. He Lost His Mother In His First Consulship, And His Sister Octavia, When He Was In The Fifty-fourth Year Of His Age . He Behaved Towards Them Both With The Utmost Kindness Whilst Living, And After Their Decease Paid The Highest Honours To Their Memory.</a> <span class="flex">240</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="243">Lxiii. By Scribonia He Had A Daughter Named Julia, But No Children By Livia, Although Extremely Desirous Of Issue. She, Indeed, Conceived Once, But Miscarried. He Gave His Daughter Julia In The First Instance To Marcellus, His Sister’s Son, Who Had Just Completed His Minority; And, After His Death, To Marcus Agrippa, Having Prevailed With His Sister To Yield Her Son-in-law To His Wishes; For At That Time Agrippa Was Married To One Of The Marcellas, And Had Children By Her. Agrippa Dying Also, He For A Long Time Thought Of Several Matches For Julia In Even The Equestrian Order, And At Last Resolved Upon Selecting Tiberius For His Step-son; And He Obliged Him To Part With His Wife At That Time Pregnant, And Who Had Already Brought Him A Child. Mark Antony Writes, “That He First Contracted Julia To His Son, And Afterwards To Cotiso, King Of The Getae , Demanding At The Same Time The King’s Daughter In Marriage For Himself.”</a> <span class="flex">243</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="246">Lxv. But In The Midst Of All His Joy And Hopes In His Numerous And Well-regulated Family, His Fortune Failed Him. The Two Julias, His Daughter And Grand-daughter, Abandoned Themselves To Such Courses Of Lewdness And Debauchery, That He Banished Them Both. Caius And Lucius He Lost Within The Space Of Eighteen Months; The Former Dying In Lycia, And The Latter At Marseilles. His Third Grandson Agrippa, With His Step-son Tiberius, He Adopted In The Forum, By A Law Passed For The Purpose By The Sections ; But He Soon Afterwards Discarded Agrippa For His Coarse And Unruly Temper, And Confined Him At Surrentum. He Bore The Death Of His Relations With More Patience Than He Did Their Disgrace; For He Was Not Overwhelmed By The Loss Of Caius And Lucius; But In The Case Of His Daughter, He Stated The Facts To The Senate In A Message Read To Them By  The Quaestor, Not Having The Heart To Be Present Himself; Indeed, He Was So Much Ashamed Of Her Infamous Conduct, That For Some Time He Avoided All Company, And Had Thoughts Of Putting Her To Death. It Is Certain That When One Phoebe, A Freed-woman And Confidant Of Hers, Hanged Herself About The Same Time, He Said, “I Had Rather Be The Father Of Phoebe Than Of Julia.” In Her Banishment He Would Not Allow Her The Use Of Wine, Nor Any Luxury In Dress; Nor Would He Suffer Her To Be Waited Upon By Any Male Servant, Either Freeman Or Slave, Without His Permission, And Having Received An Exact Account Of His Age, Stature, Complexion, And What Marks Or Scars He Had About Him. At The End Of Five Years He Removed Her From The Island [Where She Was Confined] To The Continent , And Treated Her With Less Severity, But Could Never Be Prevailed Upon To Recall Her. When The Roman People Interposed On Her Behalf Several Times With Much Importunity, All The Reply He Gave Was: “I Wish You Had All Such Daughters And Wives As She Is.” He Likewise Forbad A Child, Of Which His Grand-daughter Julia Was Delivered After Sentence Had Passed Against Her, To Be Either Owned As A Relation, Or Brought Up. Agrippa, Who Was Equally Intractable, And Whose Folly Increased Every Day, He Transported To An Island , And Placed A Guard Of Soldiers About Him; Procuring At The Same Time An Act Of The Senate For His Confinement There During Life. Upon Any Mention Of Him And The Two Julias, He Would Say, With A Heavy Sigh,</a> <span class="flex">246</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="248">Lxvi. He Was Cautious In Forming Friendships, But Clung To Them With Great Constancy; Not Only Rewarding The Virtues And Merits Of His Friends According To Their Deserts, But Bearing Likewise With Their Faults And Vices, Provided That They Were  Of A Venial Kind. For Amongst All His Friends, We Scarcely Find Any Who Fell Into Disgrace With Him, Except Salvidienus Rufus, Whom He Raised To The Consulship, And Cornelius Gallus, Whom He Made Prefect Of Egypt; Both Of Them Men Of The Lowest Extraction. One Of These, Being Engaged In Plotting A Rebellion, He Delivered Over To The Senate, For Condemnation; And The Other, On Account Of His Ungrateful And Malicious Temper, He Forbad His House, And His Living In Any Of The Provinces. When, However, Gallus, Being Denounced By His Accusers, And Sentenced By The Senate, Was Driven To The Desperate Extremity Of Laying Violent Hands Upon Himself, He Commended, Indeed, The Attachment To His Person Of Those Who Manifested So Much Indignation, But He Shed Tears, And Lamented His Unhappy Condition, “That I Alone,” Said He, “Cannot Be Allowed To Resent The Misconduct Of My Friends In Such A Way Only As I Would Wish.” The Rest Of His Friends Of All Orders Flourished During Their Whole Lives, Both In Power And Wealth, In The Highest Ranks Of Their Several Orders, Notwithstanding Some Occasional Lapses. For, To Say Nothing Of Others, He Sometimes Complained That Agrippa Was Hasty, And Mecaenas A Tattler; The Former Having Thrown Up All His Employments And Retired To Mitylene, On Suspicion Of Some Slight Coolness, And From Jealousy That Marcellus Received Greater Marks Of Favour; And The Latter Having Confidentially Imparted To His Wife Terentia The Discovery Of Muraena’s Conspiracy.</a> <span class="flex">248</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="251">Lxvii. As A Patron And Master, His Behaviour In General Was Mild And Conciliating; But When Occasion Required It, He  Could Be Severe. He Advanced Many Of His Freedmen To Posts Of Honour And Great Importance, As Licinus, Enceladus, And Others; And When His Slave, Cosmus, Had Reflected Bitterly Upon Him, He Resented The Injury No Further Than By Putting Him In Fetters. When His Steward, Diomedes, Left Him To The Mercy Of A Wild Boar, Which Suddenly Attacked Them While They Were Walking Together, He Considered It Rather A Cowardice Than A Breach Of Duty; And Turned An Occurrence Of No Small Hazard Into A Jest, Because There Was No Knavery In His Steward’s Conduct. He Put To Death Proculus, One Of His Most Favourite Freedmen, For Maintaining A Criminal Commerce With Other Men’s Wives. He Broke The Legs Of His Secretary, Thallus, For Taking A Bribe Of Five Hundred Denarii To Discover The Contents Of One Of His Letters. And The Tutor And Other Attendants Of His Son Caius, Having Taken Advantage Of His Sickness And Death, To Give Loose To Their Insolence And Rapacity In The Province He Governed, He Caused Heavy Weights To Be Tied About Their Necks, And Had Them Thrown Into A River.</a> <span class="flex">251</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="252">Lxviii. In His Early Youth Various Aspersions Of An Infamous Character Were Heaped Upon Him. Sextus Pompey Reproached Him With Being An Effeminate Fellow; And M. Antony, With Earning His Adoption From His Uncle By Prostitution. Lucius Antony, Likewise Mark’s Brother, Charges Him With Pollution By Caesar; And That, For A Gratification Of Three Hundred Thousand Sesterces, He Had Submitted To Aulus Hirtius In The Same Way, In Spain; Adding, That He Used To Singe His Legs With Burnt Nut-shells, To Make The Hair Become Softer . Nay, The Whole Concourse Of The People, At Some Public Diversions In The Theatre, When The Following Sentence Was Recited, Alluding To The Gallic Priest Of The Mother Of The Gods , Beating A Drum ,</a> <span class="flex">252</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="255">Lxx. A Private Entertainment Which He Gave, Commonly Called The Supper Of The Twelve Gods , And At Which The Guests  Were Dressed In The Habit Of Gods And Goddesses, While He Personated Apollo Himself, Afforded Subject Of Much Conversation, And Was Imputed To Him Not Only By Antony In His Letters, Who Likewise Names All The Parties Concerned, But In The Following Well-known Anonymous Verses:</a> <span class="flex">255</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="258">Lxxi. With Respect To The Charge Or Imputation Of Loathsome Impurity Before-mentioned, He Very Easily Refuted It By The Chastity Of His Life, At The Very Time When It Was Made, As Well As Ever Afterwards. His Conduct Likewise Gave The Lie To That Of Luxurious Extravagance In His Furniture, When, Upon The Taking Of Alexandria, He Reserved For Himself Nothing Of The Royal Treasures But A Porcelain Cup, And Soon Afterwards Melted Down All The Vessels Of Gold, Even Such As Were Intended For Common Use. But His Amorous Propensities Never Left Him, And, As He Grew Older, As Is Reported, He Was In The Habit Of Debauching Young Girls, Who Were Procured For Him, From All Quarters, Even By His Own Wife. To The Observations On His Gaming, He Paid Not The Smallest Regard; But Played In Public, But Purely For His Diversion, Even When He Was Advanced In Years; And Not Only In The Month Of December , But At Other Times, And Upon All Days, Whether Festivals Or Not. This Evidently Appears From A Letter Under His Own Hand, In Which He Says, “I Supped, My Dear Tiberius, With The Same Company. We Had, Besides, Vinicius, And Silvius The Father. We Gamed At Supper Like Old Fellows, Both Yesterday And Today. And As Any One Threw Upon The Tali  Aces Or Sixes, He Put Down For Every Talus A Denarius; All Which Was Gained By Him Who Threw A Venus.”  In Another Letter, He Says: “We Had, My Dear Tiberius, A Pleasant Time Of It During The Festival Of Minerva: For We Played Every Day, And Kept The Gaming-board Warm. Your Brother Uttered Many Exclamations At A Desperate Run Of Ill-fortune; But Recovering By Degrees, And Unexpectedly, He In The End Lost Not Much. I Lost Twenty Thousand Sesterces For My Part; But Then I Was Profusely  Generous In My Play, As I Commonly Am; For Had I Insisted Upon The Stakes Which I Declined, Or Kept What I Gave Away, I Should Have Won About Fifty Thousand. But This I Like Better For It Will Raise My Character For Generosity To The Skies.” In A Letter To His Daughter, He Writes Thus: “I Have Sent You Two Hundred And Fifty Denarii, Which I Gave To Every One Of My Guests; In Case They Were Inclined At Supper To Divert Themselves With The Tali, Or At The Game Of Even-or-odd.”</a> <span class="flex">258</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="259">Lxxii. In Other Matters, It Appears That He Was Moderate In His Habits, And Free From Suspicion Of Any Kind Of Vice. He Lived At First Near The Roman Forum, Above The Ring-maker’s Stairs, In A House Which Had Once Been Occupied By Calvus The Orator. He Afterwards Moved To The Palatine Hill, Where He Resided In A Small House  Belonging To Hortensius, No Way Remarkable Either For Size Or Ornament; The Piazzas Being But Small, The Pillars Of Alban Stone , And The Rooms Without Any Thing Of Marble, Or Fine Paving. He Continued To Use The Same Bed-chamber, Both Winter And Summer, During Forty Years : For Though He Was Sensible That The City Did Not Agree With His Health In The Winter, He Nevertheless Resided Constantly In It During That Season. If At Any Time He Wished To Be Perfectly Retired, And Secure From Interruption, He Shut Himself Up In An Apartment At The Top Of His House, Which He Called His Syracuse Or Technophuon , Or He Went To Some Villa Belonging To His Freedmen Near The City. But When He Was Indisposed, He Commonly Took Up His Residence In The House Of Mecaenas . Of All The Places Of Retirement From The City, He  Chiefly Frequented Those Upon The Sea-coast, And The Islands Of Campania , Or The Towns Nearest The City, Such As Lanuvium, Praeneste, And Tibur , Where He Often Used To Sit For The Administration Of Justice, In The Porticos Of The Temple Of Hercules. He Had A Particular Aversion To Large And Sumptuous Palaces; And Some Which Had Been Raised At A Vast Expense By His Grand-daughter, Julia, He Levelled To The Ground. Those Of His Own, Which Were Far From Being Spacious, He Adorned, Not So Much With Statues And Pictures, As With Walks And Groves, And Things Which Were Curious Either For Their Antiquity Or Rarity; Such As, At Capri, The Huge Limbs Of Sea-monsters And Wild Beasts, Which Some Affect To Call The Bones Of Giants; And Also The Arms Of Ancient Heroes.</a> <span class="flex">259</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="260">Lxxiii. His Frugality In The Furniture Of His House Appears Even At This Day, From Some Beds And Tables Still Remaining, Most Of Which Are Scarcely Elegant Enough For A Private Family. It Is Reported That He Never Lay Upon A Bed, But Such As Was Low, And Meanly Furnished. He Seldom Wore Any Garment But What Was Made By The Hands Of His Wife, Sister, Daughter, And Grand-daughters. His Togas  Were Neither Scanty Nor Full;  And The Clavus Was Neither Remarkably Broad Or Narrow. His Shoes Were A Little Higher Than Common, To Make Him Appear Taller Than He Was. He Had Always Clothes And Shoes, Fit To Appear In Public, Ready In His Bed-chamber For Any Sudden Occasion.</a> <span class="flex">260</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="261">Lxxiv. At His Table, Which Was Always Plentiful And Elegant, He Constantly Entertained Company; But Was Very Scrupulous In The Choice Of Them, Both As To Rank And Character. Valerius Messala Informs Us, That He Never Admitted Any Freedman To His Table, Except Menas, When Rewarded With The Privilege Of Citizenship, For Betraying Pompey’s Fleet. He Writes, Himself, That He Invited To His Table A Person In Whose Villa He Lodged, And Who Had Formerly Been Employed By Him As A Spy. He Often Came Late To Table, And Withdrew Early; So That The Company Began Supper Before His Arrival, And Continued At Table After His Departure. His Entertainments Consisted Of Three Entries, Or At Most Of Only Six. But If His Fare Was Moderate, His Courtesy Was Extreme. For Those Who Were Silent, Or Talked In Whispers, He Encouraged To Join In The General Conversation; And Introduced Buffoons And Stage Players, Or Even Low Performers From The Circus, And Very Often Itinerant Humourists, To Enliven The Company.</a> <span class="flex">261</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="262">Lxxv. Festivals And Holidays He Usually Celebrated Very Expensively, But Sometimes Only With Merriment. In The Saturnalia, Or At Any Other Time When The Fancy Took Him, He Distributed To His Company Clothes, Gold, And Silver; Sometimes Coins Of All Sorts, Even Of The Ancient Kings Of Rome And Of Foreign Nations; Sometimes Nothing But Towels, Sponges, Rakes, And Tweezers, And Other Things Of That Kind, With Tickets On Them, Which Were Enigmatical, And Had A Double Meaning . He Used Likewise To Sell By Lot Among His Guests Articles Of Very Unequal Value, And Pictures With Their Fronts Reversed; And So, By The Unknown Quality Of The Lot, Disappoint Or Gratify The Expectation Of The Purchasers. This Sort Of Traffic  Went Round The Whole Company, Every One Being Obliged To Buy Something, And To Run The Chance Of Loss Or Gain Wits The Rest.</a> <span class="flex">262</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="263">Lxxvi. He Ate Sparingly , And Commonly Used A Plain Diet. He Was Particularly Fond Of Coarse Bread, Small Fishes, New Cheese Made Of Cow’s Milk , And Green Figs Of The Sort Which Bear Fruit Twice A Year . He Did Not Wait For Supper, But Took Food At Any Time, And In Any Place, When He Had An Appetite. The Following Passages Relative To This Subject, I Have Transcribed From His Letters. “I Ate A Little Bread And Some Small Dates, In My Carriage.” Again. “In Returning Home From The Palace In My Litter, I Ate An Ounce Of Bread, And A Few Raisins.” Again. “No Jew, My Dear Tiberius, Ever Keeps Such Strict Fast Upon The Sabbath , As I Have To-day; For While In The Bath, And After The First Hour Of The Night, I Only Ate Two Biscuits, Before I Began To Be Rubbed With Oil.” From This Great Indifference About His Diet, He Sometimes Supped By Himself, Before His Company Began, Or After They Had Finished, And Would Not Touch A Morsel At Table With His Guests.</a> <span class="flex">263</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="264">Lxxvii. He Was By Nature Extremely Sparing In The Use Of Wine. Cornelius Nepos Says, That He Used To Drink Only Three Times At Supper In The Camp At Modena; And When He Indulged Himself The Most, He Never Exceeded A Pint; Or If He Did, His Stomach Rejected It. Of All Wines, He Gave The  Preference To The Rhaetian , But Scarcely Ever Drank Any In The Day-time. Instead Of Drinking, He Used To Take A Piece Of Bread Dipped In Cold Water, Or A Slice Of Cucumber, Or Some Leaves Of Lettuce, Or A Green, Sharp, Juicy Apple.</a> <span class="flex">264</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="265">Lxxviii. After A Slight Repast At Noon, He Used To Seek Repose , Dressed As He Was, And With His Shoes On, His Feet Covered, And His Hand Held Before His Eyes. After Supper He Commonly Withdrew To His Study, A Small Closet, Where He Sat Late, Until He Had Put Down In His Diary All Or Most Of The Remaining Transactions Of The Day, Which He Had Not Before Registered. He Would Then Go To Bed, But Never Slept Above Seven Hours At Most, And That Not Without Interruption; For He Would Wake Three Or Four Times During That Time. If He Could Not Again Fall Asleep, As Sometimes Happened, He Called For Some One To Read Or Tell Stories To Him, Until He Became Drowsy, And Then His Sleep Was Usually Protracted Till After Day-break. He Never Liked To Lie Awake In The Dark, Without Somebody To Sit By Him. Very Early Rising Was Apt To Disagree With Him. On Which Account, If He Was Obliged To Rise Betimes, For Any Civil Or Religious Functions, In Order To Guard As Much As Possible Against The Inconvenience Resulting From It, He Used To Lodge In Some Apartment Near The Spot, Belonging To Any Of His Attendants. If At Any Time A Fit Of Drowsiness Seized Him In Passing Along The Streets, His Litter Was Set Down While He Snatched A Few Moments’ Sleep.</a> <span class="flex">265</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="266">Lxxix. In Person He Was Handsome And Graceful, Through Every Period Of His Life. But He Was Negligent In His Dress; And So Careless About Dressing His Hair, That He Usually Had It Done In Great Haste, By Several Barbers At A Time. His Beard He Sometimes Clipped, And Sometimes Shaved; And Either Read Or Wrote During The Operation. His Countenance, Either When Discoursing Or Silent, Was So Calm And Serene, That A  Gaul Of The First Rank Declared Amongst His Friends, That He Was So Softened By It, As To Be Restrained From Throwing Him Down A Precipice, In His Passage Over The Alps, When He Had Been Admitted To Approach Him, Under Pretence Of Conferring With Him. His Eyes Were Bright And Piercing; And He Was Willing It Should Be Thought That There Was Something Of A Divine Vigour In Them. He Was Likewise Not A Little Pleased To See People, Upon His Looking Steadfastly At Them, Lower Their Countenances, As If The Sun Shone In Their Eyes. But In His Old Age, He Saw Very Imperfectly With His Left Eye. His Teeth Were Thin Set, Small And Scaly, His Hair A Little Curled, And Inclining To A Yellow Colour. His Eye-brows Met; His Ears Were Small, And He Had An Aquiline Nose. His Complexion Was Betwixt Brown And Fair; His Stature But Low; Though Julius Marathus, His Freedman, Says He Was Five Feet And Nine Inches In Height. This, However, Was So Much Concealed By The Just Proportion Of His Limbs, That It Was Only Perceivable Upon Comparison With Some Taller Person Standing By Him.</a> <span class="flex">266</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="267">Lxxx. He Is Said To Have Been Born With Many Spots Upon His Breast And Belly, Answering To The Figure, Order, And Number Of The Stars In The Constellation Of The Bear. He Had Besides Several Callosities Resembling Scars, Occasioned By An Itching In His Body, And The Constant And Violent Use Of The Strigil  In Being Rubbed. He Had A Weakness In His Left Hip, Thigh, And Leg, Insomuch That He Often Halted On That Side; But He Received Much Benefit From The Use Of Sand And Reeds. He Likewise Sometimes Found The Fore-finger Of His Right Hand So Weak, That When It Was Benumbed And Contracted With Cold, To Use It In Writing, He Was Obliged To Have Recourse To A Circular Piece Of Horn. He Had Occasionally A Complaint In The Bladder; But Upon Voiding Some Stones In His Urine, He Was Relieved From That Pain.</a> <span class="flex">267</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="268">Lxxxi. During The Whole Course Of His Life, He Suffered, At Times, Dangerous Fits Of Sickness, Especially After The Conquest Of Cantabria; When His Liver Being Injured By A Defluxion  Upon It, He Was Reduced To Such A Condition, That He Was Obliged To Undergo A Desperate And Doubtful Method Of Cure: For Warm Applications Having No Effect, Antonius Musa  Directed The Use Of Those Which Were Cold. He Was Likewise Subject To Fits Of Sickness At Stated Times Every Year; For About His Birth-day  He Was Commonly A Little Indisposed. In The Beginning Of Spring, He Was Attacked With An Inflation Of The Midriff; And When The Wind Was Southerly, With A Cold In His Head. By All These Complaints, His Constitution Was So Shattered, That He Could Not Easily Bear Either Heat Or Cold.</a> <span class="flex">268</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="269">Lxxxii. In Winter, He Was Protected Against The Inclemency Of The Weather By A Thick Toga, Four Tunics, A Shirt, A Flannel Stomacher, And Swathings Upon His Legs And Thighs . In Summer, He Lay With The Doors Of His Bedchamber Open, And Frequently In A Piazza, Refreshed By A Bubbling Fountain, And A Person Standing By To Fan Him. He Could Not Bear Even The Winter’s Sun; And At Home, Never Walked In The Open Air Without A Broad-brimmed Hat On His Head. He Usually Travelled In A Litter, And By Night: And So Slow, That He Was Two Days In Going To Praeneste Or Tibur. And If He Could Go To Any Place By Sea, He Preferred That Mode Of Travelling. He Carefully Nourished His Health Against His Many Infirmities, Avoiding Chiefly The Free Use Of The Bath; But He Was Often Rubbed With Oil, And Sweated In A Stove; After Which He Was Washed With Tepid Water, Warmed Either By A Fire, Or By Being Exposed To The Heat Of The Sun. When, Upon Account Of His Nerves, He Was Obliged To Have Recourse To Sea-water, Or The Waters Of Albula , He Was Contented With Sitting Over A Wooden Tub, Which He Called By A Spanish Name  Dureta, And Plunging His Hands And Feet In The Water By Turns.</a> <span class="flex">269</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="270">Lxxxiii. As Soon As The Civil Wars Were Ended, He Gave Up Riding And Other Military Exercises In The Campus Martius, And Took To Playing At Ball, Or Foot-ball; But Soon Afterwards Used No Other Exercise Than That Of Going Abroad In His Litter, Or Walking. Towards The End Of His Walk, He Would Run Leaping, Wrapped Up In A Short Cloak Or Cape. For Amusement He Would Sometimes Angle, Or Play With Dice, Pebbles, Or Nuts, With Little Boys, Collected From Various Countries, And Particularly Moors And Syrians, For Their Beauty Or Amusing Talk. But Dwarfs, And Such As Were In Any Way Deformed, He Held In Abhorrence, As Lusus Naturae , And Of Evil Omen.</a> <span class="flex">270</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="271">Lxxxiv. From Early Youth He Devoted Himself With Great Diligence And Application To The Study Of Eloquence, And The Other Liberal Arts. In The War Of Modena, Notwithstanding The Weighty Affairs In Which He Was Engaged, He Is Said To Have Read, Written, And Declaimed Every Day. He Never Addressed The Senate, The People, Or The Army, But In A Premeditated Speech, Though He Did Not Want The Talent Of Speaking Extempore On The Spur Of The Occasion. And Lest His Memory Should Fail Him, As Well As To Prevent The Loss Of Time In Getting Up His Speeches, It Was His General Practice To Recite Them. In His Intercourse With Individuals, And Even With His Wife Livia, Upon Subjects Of Importance He Wrote On His Tablets All He Wished To Express, Lest, If He Spoke Extempore, He Should Say More Or Less Than Was Proper. He Delivered Himself In A Sweet And Peculiar Tone, In Which He Was Diligently Instructed By A Master Of Elocution. But When He Had A Cold, He Sometimes Employed A Herald To Deliver His Speeches To The People.</a> <span class="flex">271</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="272">Lxxxv. He Composed Many Tracts In Prose On Various Subjects, Some Of Which He Read Occasionally In The Circle Of His Friends, As To An Auditory. Among These Was His “Rescript To Brutus Respecting Cato.” Most Of The Pages He Read Himself, Although He Was Advanced In Years, But Becoming Fatigued, He Gave The Rest To Tiberius To Finish. He Likewise Read Over To  His Friends His “Exhortations To Philosophy,” And The “History Of His Own Life,” Which He Continued In Thirteen Books, As Far As The Cantabrian War, But No Farther. He Likewise Made Some Attempts At Poetry. There Is Extant One Book Written By Him In Hexameter Verse, Of Which Both The Subject And Title Is “Sicily.” There Is Also A Book Of Epigrams, No Larger Than The Last, Which He Composed Almost Entirely While He Was In The Bath. These Are All His Poetical Compositions For Though He Begun A Tragedy With Great Zest, Becoming Dissatisfied With The Style, He Obliterated The Whole; And His Friends Saying To Him, “What Is Your Ajax Doing?” He Answered, “My Ajax Has Met With A Sponge.”</a> <span class="flex">272</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="273">Lxxxvi. He Cultivated A Style Which Was Neat And Chaste, Avoiding Frivolous Or Harsh Language, As Well As Obsolete Words, Which He Calls Disgusting. His Chief Object Was To Deliver His Thoughts With All Possible Perspicuity. To Attain This End, And That He Might Nowhere Perplex, Or Retard The Reader Or Hearer, He Made No Scruple To Add Prepositions To His Verbs, Or To Repeat The Same Conjunction Several Times; Which, When Omitted, Occasion Some Little Obscurity, But Give A Grace To The Style. Those Who Used Affected Language, Or Adopted Obsolete Words, He Despised, As Equally Faulty, Though In Different Ways. He Sometimes Indulged Himself In Jesting, Particularly With His Friend Mecaenas, Whom He Rallied Upon All Occasions For His Fine Phrases , And Bantered By Imitating His Way Of Talking. Nor Did He Spare Tiberius, Who Was Fond Of Obsolete And Far-fetched Expressions. He Charges Mark Antony With Insanity, Writing Rather To Make Men Stare, Than To Be Understood; And By Way Of Sarcasm Upon His Depraved And Fickle Taste In The Choice Of Words, He Writes To Him Thus: “And Are You Yet In Doubt, Whether Cimber Annius Or Veranius Flaccus Be More Proper For Your Imitation? Whether You Will Adopt Words Which Sallustius Crispus Has Borrowed From The ‘Origines’ Of Cato? Or Do You Think That The Verbose Empty Bombast Of Asiatic Orators Is Fit To Be Transfused Into  Our Language?” And In A Letter Where He Commends The Talent Of His Grand-daughter, Agrippina, He Says, “But You Must Be Particularly Careful, Both In Writing And Speaking, To Avoid Affectation.”</a> <span class="flex">273</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="274">Lxxxvii. In Ordinary Conversation, He Made Use Of Several Peculiar Expressions, As Appears From Letters In His Own Hand-writing; In Which, Now And Then, When He Means To Intimate That Some Persons Would Never Pay Their Debts, He Says, “They Will Pay At The Greek Calends.” And When He Advised Patience In The Present Posture Of Affairs, He Would Say, “Let Us Be Content With Our Cato.” To Describe Anything In Haste, He Said, “It Was Sooner Done Than Asparagus Is Cooked.” He Constantly Puts Baceolus For Stultus, Pullejaceus For Pullus, Vacerrosus For Cerritus, Vapide Se Habere For Male, And Betizare For Languere, Which Is Commonly Called Lachanizare. Likewise Simus For Sumus, Domos For Domus In The Genitive Singular . With Respect To The Last Two Peculiarities, Lest Any Person Should Imagine That They Were Only Slips Of His Pen, And Not Customary With Him, He Never Varies. I Have Likewise Remarked This Singularity In His Hand-writing; He Never Divides His Words, So As To Carry The Letters Which Cannot Be Inserted At The End Of A Line To The Next, But Puts Them Below The Other, Enclosed By A Bracket.</a> <span class="flex">274</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="275">Lxxxviii. He Did Not Adhere Strictly To Orthography As Laid Down By The Grammarians, But Seems To Have Been Of The Opinion Of Those Who Think, That We Ought To Write As We Speak; For As To His Changing And Omitting Not Only Letters But Whole Syllables, It Is A Vulgar Mistake. Nor Should I Have Taken Notice Of It, But That It Appears Strange To Me, That Any Person Should Have Told Us, That He Sent A Successor To A Consular Lieutenant Of A Province, As An Ignorant, Illiterate Fellow, Upon His Observing That He Had Written Ixi For Ipsi. When He Had Occasion To Write In Cypher, He Put B For A, C For B, And So Forth; And Instead Of Z, Aa.</a> <span class="flex">275</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="276">Lxxxix. He Was No Less Fond Of The Greek Literature, In Which He Made Considerable Proficiency; Having Had Apollodorus  Of Pergamus, For His Master In Rhetoric; Whom, Though Much Advanced In Years, He Took With Him From The City, When He Was Himself Very Young, To Apollonia. Afterwards, Being Instructed In Philology By Sephaerus, He Received Into His Family Areus The Philosopher, And His Sons Dionysius And Nicanor; But He Never Could Speak The Greek Tongue Readily, Nor Ever Ventured To Compose In It. For If There Was Occasion For Him To Deliver His Sentiments In That Language, He Always Expressed What He Had To Say In Latin, And Gave It Another To Translate. He Was Evidently Not Unacquainted With The Poetry Of The Greeks, And Had A Great Taste For The Ancient Comedy, Which He Often Brought Upon The Stage, In His Public Spectacles. In Reading The Greek And Latin Authors, He Paid Particular Attention To Precepts And Examples Which Might Be Useful In Public Or Private Life. Those He Used To Extract Verbatim, And Gave To His Domestics, Or Send To The Commanders Of The Armies, The Governors Of The Provinces, Or The Magistrates Of The City, When Any Of Them Seemed To Stand In Need Of Admonition. He Likewise Read Whole Books To The Senate, And Frequently Made Them Known To The People By His Edicts; Such As The Orations Of Quintus Metellus “For The Encouragement Of Marriage,” And Those Of Rutilius “On The Style Of Building;”  To Shew The People That He Was Not The First Who Had Promoted Those Objects, But That The Ancients Likewise Had Thought Them Worthy Their Attention. He Patronised The Men Of Genius Of That Age In Every Possible Way. He Would Hear Them Read Their Works With A Great Deal Of Patience And Good Nature; And Not Only Poetry  And History, But Orations And Dialogues. He Was Displeased, However, That Anything Should Be Written Upon Himself, Except In A Grave Manner, And By Men Of The Most Eminent Abilities: And He Enjoined The Praetors Not To Suffer His Name To Be Made Too Common In The Contests Amongst Orators And Poets In The Theatres.</a> <span class="flex">276</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="277">Xc. We Have The Following Account Of Him Respecting His  Belief In Omens And Such Like. He Had So Great A Dread Of Thunder And Lightning That He Always Carried About Him A Seal’s Skin, By Way Of Preservation. And Upon Any Apprehension Of A Violent Storm, He Would Retire To Some Place Of Concealment In A Vault Under Ground; Having Formerly Been Terrified By A Flash Of Lightning, While Travelling In The Night, As We Have Already Mentioned.</a> <span class="flex">277</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="278">Xci. He Neither Slighted His Own Dreams Nor Those Of Other People Relating To Himself. At The Battle Of Philippi, Although He Had Resolved Not To Stir Out Of His Tent, On Account Of His Being Indisposed, Yet, Being Warned By A Dream Of One Of His Friends, He Changed His Mind; And Well It Was That He Did So, For In The Enemy’s Attack, His Couch Was Pierced And Cut To Pieces, On The Supposition Of His Being In It. He Had Many Frivolous And Frightful Dreams During The Spring; But In The Other Parts Of The Year, They Were Less Frequent And More Significative. Upon His Frequently Visiting A Temple Near The Capitol, Which He Had Dedicated To Jupiter Tonans, He Dreamt That Jupiter Capitolinus Complained That His Worshippers Were Taken From Him, And That Upon This He Replied, He Had Only Given Him The Thunderer For His Porter . He Therefore Immediately Suspended Little Bells Round The Summit Of The Temple; Because Such Commonly Hung At The Gates Of Great Houses. In Consequence Of A Dream, Too, He Always, On A Certain Day Of The Year, Begged Alms Of The People, Reaching Out His Hand To Receive The Dole Which They Offered Him.</a> <span class="flex">278</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="279">Xcii. Some Signs And Omens He Regarded As Infallible. If In The Morning His Shoe Was Put On Wrong, The Left Instead Of The Right, That Boded Some Disaster. If When He Commenced A Long Journey, By Sea Or Land, There Happened To Fall A Mizzling Rain, He Held It To Be A Good Sign Of A Speedy And Happy Return. He Was Much Affected Likewise With Any Thing Out Of The Common Course Of Nature. A Palm-tree  Which  Chanced To Grow Up Between Some Stone’s In The Court Of His House, He Transplanted Into A Court Where The Images Of The Household Gods Were Placed, And Took All Possible Care To Make It Thrive In The Island Of Capri, Some Decayed Branches Of An Old Ilex, Which Hung Drooping To The Ground, Recovered Themselves Upon His Arrival; At Which He Was So Delighted, That He Made An Exchange With The Republic  Of Naples, Of The Island Of Oenaria [Ischia], For That Of Capri. He Likewise Observed Certain Days; As Never To Go From Home The Day After The Nundiae , Nor To Begin Any Serious Business Upon The Nones ; Avoiding Nothing Else In It, As He Writes To Tiberius, Than Its Unlucky Name.</a> <span class="flex">279</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="280">Xciii. With Regard To The Religious Ceremonies Of Foreign Nations, He Was A Strict Observer Of Those Which Had Been Established By Ancient Custom; But Others He Held In No Esteem. For, Having Been Initiated At Athens, And Coming Afterwards To Hear A Cause At Rome, Relative To The Privileges Of The Priests Of The Attic Ceres, When Some Of The Mysteries Of Their Sacred Rites Were To Be Introduced In The Pleadings, He Dismissed Those Who Sat Upon The Bench As Judges With Him, As Well As The By-standers, And Beard The Argument Upon Those Points Himself. But, On The Other Hand, He Not Only Declined, In His Progress Through Egypt, To Go Out Of His Way To Pay A Visit To Apis, But He Likewise Commended His Grandson Caius  For Not Paying His Devotions At Jerusalem In His Passage Through Judaea.</a> <span class="flex">280</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="281">Xciv. Since We Are Upon This Subject, It May Not Be Improper To Give An Account Of The Omens, Before And At His Birth, As Well As Afterwards, Which Gave Hopes Of His Future Greatness, And The Good Fortune That Constantly Attended Him. A Part Of The Wall Of Velletri Having In Former Times Been Struck With Thunder, The Response Of The Soothsayers Was, That A Native Of That Town Would Some Time Or Other Arrive At Supreme Power; Relying On Which Prediction, The Velletrians Both Then, And Several Times Afterwards, Made War Upon The Roman People, To Their Own Ruin. At Last It Appeared By The Event, That The Omen Had Portended The Elevation Of Augustus.</a> <span class="flex">281</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="290">Xcv. After The Death Of Caesar, Upon His Return From Apollonia, As He Was Entering The City, On A Sudden, In A Clear And Bright Sky, A Circle Resembling The Rainbow Surrounded The Body Of The Sun; And, Immediately Afterwards, The Tomb Of Julia, Caesar’s Daughter, Was Struck By Lightning. In His First Consulship, Whilst He Was Observing The Auguries, Twelve Vultures Presented Themselves, As They Had Done To Romulus. And When He Offered Sacrifice, The Livers Of All The Victims Were Folded Inward In The Lower Part; A Circumstance Which Was Regarded By Those Present, Who Had Skill In Things Of That Nature, As An Indubitable Prognostic Of Great And Wonderful Fortune.</a> <span class="flex">290</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="291">Xcvi. He Certainly Had A Presentiment Of The Issue Of All His Wars. When The Troops Of The Triumviri Were Collected About Bolognia, An Eagle, Which Sat Upon His Tent, And Was Attacked By Two Crows, Beat Them Both, And Struck Them To The Ground, In The View Of The Whole Army; Who Thence Inferred That Discord Would Arise Between The Three Colleagues, Which Would Be Attended With The Like Event: And It Accordingly Happened. At Philippi, He Was Assured Of Success By A Thessalian, Upon The Authority, As He Pretended, Of The Divine Caesar Himself, Who Had Appeared To Him While He Was Travelling In A Bye-road. At Perugia, The Sacrifice Not Presenting Any Favourable Intimations, But The Contrary, He Ordered Fresh Victims; The Enemy, However, Carrying Off The Sacred Things In A Sudden Sally, It Was Agreed Amongst The Augurs, That All The  Dangers And Misfortunes Which Had Threatened The Sacrificer, Would Fall Upon The Heads Of Those Who Had Got Possession Of The Entrails. And, Accordingly, So It Happened. The Day Before The Sea-fight Near Sicily, As He Was Walking Upon The Shore, A Fish Leaped Out Of The Sea, And Laid Itself At His Feet. At Actium, While He Was Going Down To His Fleet To Engage The Enemy, He Was Met By An Ass With A Fellow Driving It. The Name Of The Man Was Eutychus, And That Of The Animal, Nichon . After The Victory, He Erected A Brazen Statue To Each, In A Temple Built Upon The Spot Where He Had Encamped.</a> <span class="flex">291</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="292">Xcvii. His Death, Of Which I Shall Now Speak, And His Subsequent Deification, Were Intimated By Divers Manifest Prodigies. As He Was Finishing The Census Amidst A Great Crowd Of People In The Campus Martius, An Eagle Hovered Round Him Several Times, And Then Directed Its Course To A Neighbouring Temple, Where It Settled Upon The Name Of Agrippa, And At The First Letter. Upon Observing This, He Ordered His Colleague Tiberius To Put Up The Vows, Which It Is Usual To Make On Such Occasions, For The Succeeding Lustrum. For He Declared He Would Not Meddle With What It Was Probable He Should Never Accomplish, Though The Tables Were Ready Drawn For It. About The Same Time, The First Letter Of His Name, In An Inscription Upon One Of His Statues, Was Struck Out By Lightning; Which Was Interpreted As A Presage That He Would Live Only A Hundred Days Longer, The Letter C Denoting That Number; And That He Would Be Placed Amongst The Gods, As Aesar, Which Is The Remaining Part Of The Word Caesar, Signifies, In The Tuscan Language, A God . Being, Therefore, About Dispatching Tiberius To Illyricum, And Designing To Go With Him As Far As Beneventum, But Being Detained By Several Persons Who Applied To Him Respecting Causes They Had Depending, He Cried Out,  As Far As Astura ; Whence, Contrary To His Custom, He Put To Sea In The Night-time, As There Was A Favourable Wind.</a> <span class="flex">292</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="293">Xcviii. His Malady Proceeded From Diarrhoea; Notwithstanding Which, He Went Round The Coast Of Campania, And The Adjacent Islands, And Spent Four Days In That Of Capri; Where He Gave Himself Up Entirely To Repose And Relaxation. Happening To Sail By The Bay Of Puteoli, The Passengers And Mariners Aboard A Ship Of Alexandria , Just Then Arrived, Clad All In White, With Chaplets Upon Their Heads, And Offering Incense, Loaded Him With Praises And Joyful Acclamations, Crying Out, “By You We Live, By You We Sail Securely, By You Enjoy Our Liberty And Our Fortunes.” At Which Being Greatly Pleased, He Distributed To Each Of Those Who Attended Him, Forty Gold Pieces, Requiring From Them An Assurance On Oath, Not To Employ The Sum Given Them In Any Other Way, Than The Purchase Of Alexandrian Merchandize. And During Several Days Afterwards, He Distributed Togae  And Pallia, Among Other Gifts, On Condition That The Romans Should Use The Greek, And The Greeks The Roman Dress And Language. He Likewise Constantly Attended To See The Boys Perform Their Exercises, According To An Ancient Custom Still Continued At Capri. He Gave Them Likewise An Entertainment In His Presence, And Not Only Permitted, But Required From Them The Utmost Freedom In Jesting, And Scrambling For Fruit, Victuals, And Other Things Which He Threw Amongst Them. In A Word, He Indulged Himself In All The Ways Of Amusement He Could Contrive.</a> <span class="flex">293</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="297">Xcix. Upon The Day Of His Death, He Now And Then Enquired, If There Was Any Disturbance In The Town On His Account; And Calling For A Mirror, He Ordered His Hair To Be Combed, And His Shrunk Cheeks To Be Adjusted. Then Asking His Friends Who Were Admitted Into The Room, “Do Ye Think That I Have Acted My Part On The Stage Of Life Well?” He Immediately Subjoined,</a> <span class="flex">297</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="299">C. He Expired In The Same Room In Which His Father Octavius Had Died, When The Two Sextus’s, Pompey And Apuleius, Were Consuls, Upon The Fourteenth Of The Calends Of September [The 19Th August], At The Ninth Hour Of The Day, Being Seventy-six Years Of Age, Wanting Only Thirty-five Days . His Remains Were Carried By The Magistrates Of The Municipal  Towns And Colonies, From Nola To Bovillae , And In The Nighttime, Because Of The Season Of The Year. During The Intervals, The Body Lay In Some Basilica, Or Great Temple, Of Each Town. At Bovillae It Was Met By The Equestrian Order, Who Carried It To The City, And Deposited It In The Vestibule Of His Own House. The Senate Proceeded With So Much Zeal In The Arrangement Of His Funeral, And Paying Honour To His Memory, That, Amongst Several Other Proposals, Some Were For Having The Funeral Procession Made Through The Triumphal Gate, Preceded By The Image Of Victory Which Is In The Senate-house, And The Children Of Highest Rank And Of Both Sexes Singing The Funeral  Dirge. Others Proposed, That On The Day Of The Funeral, They Should Lay Aside Their Gold Rings, And Wear Rings Of Iron; And Others, That His Bones Should Be Collected By The Priests Of The Principal Colleges. One Likewise Proposed To Transfer The Name Of August To September, Because He Was Born In The Latter, But Died In The Former. Another Moved, That The Whole Period Of Time, From His Birth To His Death, Should Be Called The Augustan Age, And Be Inserted In The Calendar Under That Title. But At Last It Was Judged Proper To Be Moderate In The Honours Paid To His Memory. Two Funeral Orations Were Pronounced In His Praise, One Before The Temple Of Julius, By Tiberius; And The Other Before The Rostra, Under The Old Shops, By Drusus, Tiberius’s Son. The Body Was Then Carried Upon The Shoulders Of Senators Into The Campus Martius, And There Burnt. A Man Of Pretorian Rank Affirmed Upon Oath, That He Saw His Spirit Ascend From The Funeral Pile To Heaven. The Most Distinguished Persons Of The Equestrian Order, Bare-footed, And With Their Tunics Loose, Gathered Up His Relics , And Deposited Them In The Mausoleum, Which Had Been Built In His Sixth Consulship Between The Flaminian Way And The Bank Of The Tiber ; At Which Time Likewise He Gave The Groves And Walks About It For The Use Of The People.</a> <span class="flex">299</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="300">Ci. He Had Made A Will A Year And Four Months Before His Death, Upon The Third Of The Nones Of April [The 11Th Of April], In The Consulship Of Lucius Plancus, And Caius Silius. It Consisted Of Two Skins Of Parchment, Written Partly In His Own Hand, And Partly By His Freedmen Polybius And Hilarian; And Had Been Committed To The Custody Of The Vestal Virgins, By Whom It Was Now Produced, With Three Codicils Under Seal, As Well As The Will: All These Were Opened And Read In The Senate. He Appointed As His Direct Heirs, Tiberius For Two  Thirds Of His Estate, And Livia For The Other Third, Both Of Whom He Desired To Assume His Name. The Heirs In Remainder Were Drusus, Tiberius’s Son, For One Third, And Germanicus With His Three Sons For The Residue. In The Third Place, Failing Them, Were His Relations, And Several Of His Friends. He Left In Legacies To The Roman People Forty Millions Of Sesterces; To The Tribes  Three Millions Five Hundred Thousand; To The Pretorian Troops A Thousand Each Man; To The City Cohorts Five Hundred; And To The Legions And Soldiers Three Hundred Each; Which Several Sums He Ordered To Be Paid Immediately After His Death, Having Taken Due Care That The Money Should Be Ready In His Exchequer. For The Rest He Ordered Different Times Of Payment. In Some Of His Bequests He Went As Far As Twenty Thousand Sesterces, For The Payment Of Which He Allowed A Twelvemonth; Alleging For This Procrastination The Scantiness Of His Estate; And Declaring That Not More Than A Hundred And Fifty Millions Of Sesterces Would Come To His Heirs: Notwithstanding That During The Twenty Preceding Years, He Had Received, In Legacies From His Friends, The Sum Of Fourteen Hundred Millions; Almost The Whole Of Which, With His Two Paternal Estates , And Others Which Had Been Left Him, He Had Spent In The Service Of The State. He Left Orders That The Two Julias, His Daughter And Grand-daughter, If Anything Happened To Them, Should Not Be Buried In His Tomb . With Regard To The Three Codicils Before-mentioned, In One Of Them He Gave Orders About His Funeral; Another Contained A Summary Of His Acts, Which He Intended Should Be Inscribed On Brazen Plates, And Placed In Front Of His Mausoleum; In The Third He Had Drawn Up A Concise Account Of The State Of The Empire; The Number Of Troops Enrolled, What Money There Was In The Treasury, The Revenue, And Arrears Of Taxes; To Which Were Added The Names Of The Freedmen And Slaves From Whom The Several Accounts Might Be Taken.</a> <span class="flex">300</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="316">M. Vipsanius Agrippa Was Of Obscure Extraction, But Rendered Himself Conspicuous By His Military Talents. He Obtained A Victory Over Sextus Pompey; And In The Battles Of Philippi And Actium, Where He Displayed Great Valour, He Contributed Not A Little To Establish The Subsequent Power Of Augustus. In His Expeditions Afterwards Into Gaul And Germany, He Performed Many Signal Achievements, For Which He Refused The Honours Of A Triumph. The Expenses Which Others Would Have Lavished On That Frivolous Spectacle, He Applied To The More Laudable Purpose Of Embellishing Rome With Magnificent Buildings, One Of Which, The Pantheon, Still Remains. In Consequence Of A Dispute With Marcellus, The Nephew Of Augustus, He Retired To Mitylene,  Whence, After An Absence Of Two Years, He Was Recalled By The Emperor. He First Married Pomponia, The Daughter Of The Celebrated Atticus, And Afterwards One Of The Marcellas, The Nieces Of Augustus. While This Lady, By Whom He Had Children, Was Still Living, The Emperor Prevailed Upon His Sister Octavia To Resign To Him Her Son-in-law, And Gave Him In Marriage His Own Daughter Julia; So Strong Was The Desire Of Augustus To Be United With Him In The Closest Alliance. The High Degree Of Favour In Which He Stood With The Emperor Was Soon After Evinced By A Farther Mark Of Esteem: For During A Visit To The Roman Provinces Of Greece And Asia, In Which Augustus Was Absent Two Years, He Left The Government Of The Empire To The Care Of Agrippa. While This Minister Enjoyed, And Indeed Seems To Have Merited, All The Partiality Of Augustus, He Was Likewise A Favourite With The People. He Died At Rome, In The Sixty-first Year Of His Age, Universally Lamented; And His Remains Were Deposited In The Tomb Which Augustus Had Prepared For Himself. Agrippa Left By Julia Three Sons, Caius, Lucius, And Posthumus Agrippa, With Two Daughters, Agrippina And Julia.</a> <span class="flex">316</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="317">C. Cilnius Mecaenas Was Of Tuscan Extraction, And Derived His Descent From The Ancient Kings Of That Country. Though In The Highest Degree Of Favour With Augustus, He Never Aspired Beyond The Rank Of The Equestrian Order; And Though He Might Have Held The Government Of Extensive Provinces By Deputies, He Was Content With Enjoying The Praefecture Of The City And Italy; A Situation, However, Which Must Have Been Attended With Extensive Patronage. He Was Of A Gay And Social Disposition. In Principle He Is Said To Have Been Of The Epicurean Sect, And In His Dress And Manners To Have Bordered On Effeminacy. With Respect To His Political Talents, We Can Only Speak From Conjecture; But From His Being The Confidential Minister Of A Prince Of So Much Discernment As Augustus, During The Infancy Of A New Form Of Government In An Extensive Empire, We May Presume That He Was Endowed With No Common Abilities For That Important Station. The Liberal Patronage Which He Displayed Towards Men Of Genius And Talents, Will Render His Name For Ever Celebrated In The Annals Of Learning. It Is To Be Regretted That History Has Transmitted No Particulars Of This Extraordinary Personage, Of Whom All We Know Is Derived Chiefly From The Writings Of Virgil And Horace; But From The Manner In Which They Address Him, Amidst The Familiarity Of Their Intercourse, There Is The Strongest Reason To Suppose, That He Was Not Less Amiable And Respectable In Private Life, Than Illustrious In Public Situation. “O My Glory!” Is The Emphatic Expression Employed By Them Both.</a> <span class="flex">317</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="416">Tiberius Nero Caesar.</a> <span class="flex">416</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="417">I. The Patrician Family Of The Claudii  Lucius, When, Of The Two Races Who Bore It, One Individual Had Been Convicted Of Robbery, And Another Of Murder. Amongst Other Cognomina, They Assumed That Of Nero, Which In The Sabine Language Signifies Strong And Valiant.</a> <span class="flex">417</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="418">Ii. It Appears From Record, That Many Of The Claudii Have Performed Signal Services To The State, As Well As Committed Acts Of Delinquency. To Mention The Most Remarkable Only, Appius Caecus Dissuaded The Senate From Agreeing To An Alliance With Pyrrhus, As Prejudicial To The Republic . Claudius Candex First Passed The Straits Of Sicily With A Fleet, And Drove The Carthaginians Out Of The Island . Claudius Nero Cut Off Hasdrubal With A Vast Army Upon His Arrival In Italy From Spain, Before He Could Form A Junction With His Brother Hannibal . On The Other Hand, Claudius Appius Regillanus, One Of The Decemvirs, Made A Violent Attempt To Have A Free Virgin, Of Whom He Was Enamoured, Adjudged A Slave; Which Caused The People To Secede A Second Time From The Senate . Claudius Drusus Erected A Statue Of Himself Wearing A Crown At Appii Forum , And Endeavoured, By Means Of His Dependants, To Make Himself Master Of Italy. Claudius Pulcher, When, Off The Coast Of Sicily , The Pullets Used For Taking Augury Would Not Eat, In Contempt Of The Omen Threw Them Overboard, As If They Should Drink At Least, If They Would Not Eat; And Then Engaging The Enemy, Was Routed. After His Defeat, When He  Was Ordered By The Senate To Name A Dictator, Making A Sort Of Jest Of The Public Disaster, He Named Glycias, His Apparitor.</a> <span class="flex">418</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="421">Iii. From This Family Tiberius Caesar Is Descended; Indeed Both By The Father And Mother’s Side; By The Former From Tiberius Nero, And By The Latter From Appius Pulcher, Who Were Both Sons Of Appius Caecus. He Likewise Belonged To The Family Of The Livii, By The Adoption Of His Mother’s Grandfather Into It; Which Family, Although Plebeian, Made A  Distinguished Figure, Having Had The Honour Of Eight Consulships, Two Censorships, Three Triumphs, One Dictatorship, And The Office Of Master Of The Horse; And Was Famous For Eminent Men, Particularly, Salinator And The Drusi. Salinator, In His Censorship , Branded All The Tribes, For Their Inconstancy In Having Made Him Consul A Second Time, As Well As Censor, Although They Had Condemned Him To A Heavy Fine After His First Consulship. Drusus Procured For Himself And His Posterity A New Surname, By Killing In Single Combat Drausus, The Enemy’s Chief. He Is Likewise Said To Have Recovered, When Pro-praetor In The Province Of Gaul, The Gold Which Was Formerly Given To The Senones, At The Siege Of The Capitol, And Had Not, As Is Reported, Been Forced From Them By Camillus. His Great-great-grandson, Who, For His Extraordinary Services Against The Gracchi, Was Styled The “Patron Of The Senate,” Left A Son, Who, While Plotting In A Sedition Of The Same Description, Was Treacherously Murdered By The Opposite Party.</a> <span class="flex">421</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="422">Iv. But The Father Of Tiberius Caesar, Being Quaestor To Caius Caesar, And Commander Of His Fleet In The War Of Alexandria, Contributed Greatly To Its Success. He Was Therefore Made One Of The High-priests In The Room Of Publius Scipio ; And Was Sent To Settle Some Colonies In Gaul, And Amongst The Rest, Those Of Narbonne And Arles . After The Assassination Of Caesar, However, When The Rest Of The Senators, For Fear Of Public Disturbances; Were For Having The Affair Buried In Oblivion, He Proposed A Resolution For Rewarding Those Who Had Killed The Tyrant. Having Filled The Office Of Praetor , And At The End Of The Year A Disturbance Breaking Out Amongst The Triumviri, He Kept The Badges Of His Office Beyond The Legal Time; And Following Lucius Antonius The Consul, Brother Of The Triumvir, To Perusia , Though The Rest Submitted, Yet He Himself Continued Firm To The Party, And Escaped First To Praeneste, And Then To Naples; Whence, Having In Vain Invited The Slaves To Liberty, He Fled Over To Sicily. But Resenting  His Not Being Immediately Admitted Into The Presence Of Sextus Pompey, And Being Also Prohibited The Use Of The Fasces, He Went Over Into Achaia To Mark Antony; With Whom, Upon A Reconciliation Soon After Brought About Amongst The Several Contending Parties, He Returned To Rome; And, At The Request Of Augustus, Gave Up To Him His Wife Livia Drusilla, Although She Was Then Big With Child, And Had Before Borne Him A Son. He Died Not Long After; Leaving Behind Him Two Sons, Tiberius And Drusus Nero.</a> <span class="flex">422</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="423">V. Some Have Imagined That Tiberius Was Born At Fundi, But There Is Only This Trifling Foundation For The Conjecture, That His Mother’s Grandmother Was Of Fundi, And That The Image Of Good Fortune Was, By A Decree Of The Senate, Erected In A Public Place In That Town. But According To The Greatest Number Of Writers, And Those Too Of The Best Authority, He Was Born At Rome, In The Palatine Quarter, Upon The Sixteenth Of The Calends Of December [16Th Nov.], When Marcus Aemilius Lepidus Was Second Time Consul, With Lucius Munatius Plancus , After The Battle Of Philippi; For So It Is Registered In The Calendar, And The Public Acts. According To Some, However, He Was Born The Preceding Year, In The Consulship Of Hirtius And Pansa; And Others Say, In The Year Following, During The Consulship Of Servilius Isauricus And Antony.</a> <span class="flex">423</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="424">Vi. His Infancy And Childhood Were Spent In The Midst Of Danger And Trouble; For He Accompanied His Parents Everywhere In Their Flight, And Twice At Naples Nearly Betrayed Them By His Crying, When They Were Privately Hastening To A Ship, As The Enemy Rushed Into The Town; Once, When He Was Snatched From His Nurse’s Breast, And Again, From His Mother’s Bosom, By Some Of The Company, Who On The Sudden Emergency Wished To Relieve The Women Of Their Burden. Being Carried Through Sicily And Achaia, And Entrusted For Some Time To The Care Of The Lacedaemonians, Who Were Under The Protection Of The Claudian Family, Upon His Departure Thence When Travelling By Night, He Ran The Hazard Of His Life, By A Fire Which, Suddenly Bursting Out Of A Wood On All Sides, Surrounded The Whole Party So Closely, That Part Of Livia’s Dress And Hair Was Burnt. The Presents Which Were Made Him  By Pompeia, Sister To Sextus Pompey, In Sicily, Namely, A Cloak, With A Clasp, And Bullae Of Gold, Are Still In Existence, And Shewn At Baiae To This Day. After His Return To The City, Being Adopted By Marcus Gallius, A Senator, In His Will, He Took Possession Of The Estate; But Soon Afterwards Declined The Use Of His Name, Because Gallius Had Been Of The Party Opposed To Augustus. When Only Nine Years Of Age, He Pronounced A Funeral Oration In Praise Of His Father Upon The Rostra; And Afterwards, When He Had Nearly Attained The Age Of Manhood, He Attended The Chariot Of Augustus, In His Triumph For The Victory At Actium, Riding On The Left-hand Horse, Whilst Marcellus, Octavia’s Son, Rode That On The Right. He Likewise Presided At The Games Celebrated On Account Of That Victory; And In The Trojan Games Intermixed With The Circensian, He Commanded A Troop Of The Biggest Boys.</a> <span class="flex">424</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="425">Vii. After Assuming The Manly Habit, He Spent His Youth, And The Rest Of His Life Until He Succeeded To The Government, In The Following Manner: He Gave The People An Entertainment Of Gladiators, In Memory Of His Father, And Another For His Grandfather Drusus, At Different Times And In Different Places: The First In The Forum, The Second In The Amphitheatre; Some Gladiators Who Had Been Honourably Discharged, Being Induced To Engage Again, By A Reward Of A Hundred Thousand Sesterces. He Likewise Exhibited Public Sports, At Which He Was Not Present Himself. All These He Performed With Great Magnificence, At The Expense Of His Mother And Father-in-law. He Married Agrippina, The Daughter Of Marcus Agrippa, And Grand-daughter Of Caecilius Atticus, A Roman Knight, The Same Person To Whom Cicero Has Addressed So Many Epistles. After Having By Her His Son Drusus, He Was Obliged To Part With Her , Though She Retained His Affection, And Was Again Pregnant, To Make Way For Marrying Augustus’s Daughter Julia. But This He Did With Extreme Reluctance; For, Besides Having The Warmest Attachment To Agrippina, He Was Disgusted With The Conduct Of Julia, Who Had Made Indecent Advances To Him During The Lifetime Of Her Former Husband; And That She Was A Woman Of Loose Character, Was The General Opinion. At Divorcing Agrippina He Felt The Deepest Regret; And Upon Meeting Her Afterwards,  He Looked After Her With Eyes So Passionately Expressive Of Affection, That Care Was Taken She Should Never Again Come In His Sight. At First, However, He Lived Quietly And Happily With Julia; But A Rupture Soon Ensued, Which Became So Violent, That After The Loss Of Their Son, The Pledge Of Their Union, Who Was Born At Aquileia And Died In Infancy , He Never Would Sleep With Her More. He Lost His Brother Drusus In Germany, And Brought His Body To Rome, Travelling All The Way On Foot Before It.</a> <span class="flex">425</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="426">Viii. When He First Applied Himself To Civil Affairs, He Defended The Several Causes Of King Archelaus, The Trallians, And The Thessalians, Before Augustus, Who Sat As Judge At The Trials. He Addressed The Senate On Behalf Of The Laodiceans, The Thyatireans, And Chians, Who Had Suffered Greatly By An Earthquake, And Implored Relief From Rome. He Prosecuted Fannius Caepio, Who Had Been Engaged In A Conspiracy With Varro Muraena Against Augustus, And Procured Sentence Of Condemnation Against Him. Amidst All This, He Had Besides To Superintend Two Departments Of The Administration, That Of Supplying The City With Corn, Which Was Then Very Scarce, And That Of Clearing The Houses Of Correction  Throughout Italy, The Masters Of Which Had Fallen Under The Odious Suspicion Of Seizing And Keeping Confined, Not Only Travellers, But Those Whom The Fear Of Being Obliged To Serve In The Army Had Driven To Seek Refuge In Such Places.</a> <span class="flex">426</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="427">Ix. He Made His First Campaign, As A Military Tribune, In The Cantabrian War . Afterwards He Led An Army Into The East , Where He Restored The Kingdom Of Armenia To Tigranes; And Seated On A Tribunal, Put A Crown Upon His Head. He Likewise Recovered From The Parthians The Standards Which They Had Taken From Crassus. He Next Governed, For Nearly A Year, The Province Of Gallia Comata, Which Was Then In Great Disorder, On Account Of The Incursions Of The Barbarians, And The Feuds Of The Chiefs. He Afterwards Commanded In The Several Wars Against The Rhaetians, Vindelicians, Pannonians, And Germans. In The Rhaetian And Vindelician Wars, He Subdued The Nations In The Alps; And In The Pannonian Wars The Bruci, And  The Dalmatians. In The German War, He Transplanted Into Gaul Forty Thousand Of The Enemy Who Had Submitted, And Assigned Them Lands Near The Banks Of The Rhine. For These Actions, He Entered The City With An Ovation, But Riding In A Chariot, And Is Said By Some To Have Been The First That Ever Was Honoured With This Distinction. He Filled Early The Principal Offices Of State; And Passed Through The Quaestorship , Praetorship , And Consulate  Almost Successively. After Some Interval, He Was Chosen Consul A Second Time, And Held The Tribunitian Authority During Five Years.</a> <span class="flex">427</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="428">X. Surrounded By All This Prosperity, In The Prime Of Life And In Excellent Health, He Suddenly Formed The Resolution Of Withdrawing To A Greater Distance From Rome . It Is Uncertain Whether This Was The Result Of Disgust For His Wife, Whom He Neither Durst Accuse Nor Divorce, And The Connection With Whom Became Every Day More Intolerable; Or To Prevent That Indifference Towards Him, Which His Constant Residence In The City Might Produce; Or In The Hope Of Supporting And Improving By Absence His Authority In The State, If The Public Should Have Occasion For His Service. Some Are Of Opinion, That As Augustus’s Sons Were Now Grown Up To Years Of Maturity, He Voluntarily Relinquished The Possession He Had Long Enjoyed Of The Second Place In The Government, As Agrippa Had Done Before Him; Who, When M. Marcellus Was Advanced To Public Offices, Retired To Mitylene, That He Might Not Seem To Stand In The Way Of His Promotion, Or In Any Respect Lessen Him By His Presence. The Same Reason Likewise Tiberius Gave Afterwards For His Retirement; But His Pretext At This Time Was, That He Was Satiated With Honours, And Desirous Of Being Relieved From The Fatigue Of Business; Requesting Therefore That He Might Have Leave To Withdraw. And Neither The Earnest Entreaties Of His Mother, Nor The Complaint Of His Father-in-law Made Even In The Senate, That He Was Deserted By Him, Could Prevail Upon Him To Alter His Resolution. Upon Their Persisting In The Design Of Detaining Him, He Refused To Take Any Sustenance For Four Days Together. At Last, Having Obtained Permission, Leaving His Wife And Son At Rome, He Proceeded  To Ostia , Without Exchanging A Word With Those Who Attended Him, And Having Embraced But Very Few Persons At Parting.</a> <span class="flex">428</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="429">Xi. From Ostia, Journeying Along The Coast Of Campania, He Halted Awhile On Receiving Intelligence Of Augustus’s Being Taken Ill, But This Giving Rise To A Rumour That He Stayed With A View To Something Extraordinary, He Sailed With The Wind Almost Full Against Him, And Arrived At Rhodes, Having Been Struck With The Pleasantness And Healthiness Of The Island At The Time Of His Landing Therein His Return From Armenia. Here Contenting Himself With A Small House, And A Villa Not Much Larger, Near The Town, He Led Entirely A Private Life, Taking His Walks Sometimes About The Gymnasia , Without Any Lictor Or Other Attendant, And Returning The Civilities Of The Greeks With Almost As Much Complaisance As If He Had Been Upon A Level With Them. One Morning, In Settling The Course Of His Daily Excursion, He Happened To Say, That He Should Visit All The Sick People In The Town. This Being Not Rightly Understood By Those About Him, The Sick Were Brought Into A Public Portico, And Ranged In Order, According To Their Several Distempers. Being Extremely Embarrassed By This Unexpected Occurrence, He Was For Some Time Irresolute How He Should Act; But At Last He Determined To Go Round Them All, And Make An Apology For The Mistake Even To The Meanest Amongst Them, And Such As Were Entirely Unknown To Him. One Instance Only Is Mentioned, In Which He Appeared To Exercise His Tribunitian Authority. Being A Constant Attendant Upon The Schools And Lecture-rooms Of The Professors Of The Liberal Arts, On Occasion Of A Quarrel Amongst The Wrangling  Sophists, In Which He Interposed To Reconcile Them, Some Person Took The Liberty To Abuse Him As An Intruder, And Partial In The Affair. Upon This, Withdrawing Privately Home, He Suddenly Returned Attended By His Officers, And Summoning His Accuser Before His Tribunal, By A Public Crier, Ordered Him To Be Taken To Prison. Afterwards He Received Tidings That His Wife Julia Had Been Condemned For Her Lewdness And Adultery, And That A Bill Of Divorce Had Been Sent To Her In His Name, By The Authority Of Augustus. Though He Secretly Rejoiced At This Intelligence, He Thought It Incumbent Upon Him, In Point Of Decency, To Interpose In Her Behalf By Frequent Letters To Augustus, And To Allow Her To Retain The Presents Which He Had Made Her, Notwithstanding The Little Regard She Merited From Him. When The Period Of His Tribunitian Authority Expired , Declaring At Last That He Had No Other Object In His Retirement Than To Avoid All Suspicion Of Rivalship With Caius And Lucius, He Petitioned That, Since He Was Now Secure In That Respect, As They Were Come To The Age Of Manhood, And Would Easily Maintain Themselves In Possession Of The Second Place In The State, He Might Be Permitted To Visit His Friends, Whom He Was Very Desirous Of Seeing. But His Request Was Denied; And He Was Advised To Lay Aside All Concern For His Friends, Whom He Had Been So Eager To Greet.</a> <span class="flex">429</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="430">Xii. He Therefore Continued At Rhodes Much Against His Will, Obtaining, With Difficulty, Through His Mother, The Title Of Augustus’s Lieutenant, To Cover His Disgrace. He Thenceforth Lived, However, Not Only As A Private Person, But As One Suspected And Under Apprehension, Retiring Into The Interior Of The Country, And Avoiding The Visits Of Those Who Sailed That Way, Which Were Very Frequent; For No One Passed To Take Command Of An Army, Or The Government Of A Province, Without Touching At Rhodes. But There Were Fresh Reasons For Increased Anxiety. For Crossing Over To Samos, On A Visit To His Step-son Caius, Who Had Been Appointed Governor Of The East, He Found Him Prepossessed Against Him, By The Insinuations Of Marcus Lollius, His Companion And Director. He Likewise Fell Under Suspicion Of Sending By Some Centurions Who Had Been Promoted By Himself, Upon Their Return To The Camp After A Furlough, Mysterious Messages To Several Persons There, Intended, Apparently, To  Tamper With Them For A Revolt. This Jealousy Respecting His Designs Being Intimated To Him By Augustus, He Begged Repeatedly That Some Person Of Any Of The Three Orders Might Be Placed As A Spy Upon Him In Every Thing He Either Said Or Did.</a> <span class="flex">430</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="431">Xiii. He Laid Aside Likewise His Usual Exercises Of Riding And Arms; And Quitting The Roman Habit, Made Use Of The Pallium And Crepida . In This Condition He Continued Almost Two Years, Becoming Daily An Object Of Increasing Contempt And Odium; Insomuch That The People Of Nismes Pulled Down All The Images And Statues Of Him In Their Town; And Upon Mention Being Made Of Him At Table One Of The Company Said To Caius, “I Will Sail Over To Rhodes Immediately, If You Desire Me, And Bring You The Head Of The Exile;” For That Was The Appellation Now Given Him. Thus Alarmed Not Only By Apprehensions, But Real Danger, He Renewed His Solicitations For Leave To Return; And, Seconded By The Most Urgent Supplications Of His Mother, He At Last Obtained His Request; To Which An Accident Somewhat Contributed. Augustus Had Resolved To Determine Nothing In The Affair, But With The Consent Of His Eldest Son. The Latter Was At That Time Out Of Humour With Marcus Lollius, And Therefore Easily Disposed To Be Favourable To His Father-in-law. Caius Thus Acquiescing, He Was Recalled, But Upon Condition That He Should Take No Concern Whatever In The Administration Of Affairs.</a> <span class="flex">431</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="432">Xiv. He Returned To Rome After An Absence Of Nearly Eight Years , With Great And Confident Hopes Of His Future Elevation, Which He Had Entertained From His Youth, In Consequence Of Various Prodigies And Predictions. For Livia, When Pregnant With Him, Being Anxious To Discover, By Different Modes Of Divination, Whether Her Offspring Would Be A Son, Amongst Others, Took An Egg From A Hen That Was Sitting, And Kept It Warm With Her Own Hands, And Those Of Her Maids, By Turns, Until A Fine Cock-chicken, With A Large Comb, Was Hatched. Scribonius, The Astrologer, Predicted Great Things Of Him When He Was A Mere Child. “He Will Come In Time,” Said The Prophet, “To Be Even A King, But Without The Usual Badge Of Royal Dignity;” The Rule Of The Caesars Being As Yet Unknown. When He Was  Making His First Expedition, And Leading His Army Through Macedonia Into Syria, The Altars Which Had Been Formerly Consecrated At Philippi By The Victorious Legions, Blazed Suddenly With Spontaneous Fires. Soon After, As He Was Marching To Illyricum, He Stopped To Consult The Oracle Of Geryon, Near Padua; And Having Drawn A Lot By Which He Was Desired To Throw Golden Tali Into The Fountain Of Aponus , For An Answer To His Inquiries, He Did So, And The Highest Numbers Came Up. And Those Very Tali Are Still To Be Seen At The Bottom Of The Fountain. A Few Days Before His Leaving Rhodes, An Eagle, A Bird Never Before Seen In That Island, Perched On The Top Of His House. And The Day Before He Received Intelligence Of The Permission Granted Him To Return, As He Was Changing His Dress, His Tunic Appeared To Be All On Fire. He Then Likewise Had A Remarkable Proof Of The Skill Of Thrasyllus, The Astrologer, Whom, For His Proficiency In Philosophical Researches, He Had Taken Into His Family. For, Upon Sight Of The Ship Which Brought The Intelligence, He Said, Good News Was Coming Whereas Every Thing Going Wrong Before, And Quite Contrary To His Predictions, Tiberius Had Intended That Very Moment, When They Were Walking Together, To Throw Him Into The Sea, As An Impostor, And One To Whom He Had Too Hastily Entrusted His Secrets.</a> <span class="flex">432</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="433">Xv. Upon His Return To Rome, Having Introduced His Son Drusus Into The Forum, He Immediately Removed From Pompey’s House, In The Carinae, To The Gardens Of Mecaenas, On The Esquiline , And Resigned Himself Entirely To His Ease, Performing Only The Common Offices Of Civility In Private Life, Without Any Preferment In The Government. But Caius And Lucius Being Both Carried Off In The Space Of Three Years, He Was Adopted By Augustus, Along With Their Brother Agrippa; Being Obliged In The First Place To Adopt Germanicus, His Brother’s Son. After His Adoption, He Never More Acted As Master Of A  Family, Nor Exercised, In The Smallest Degree, The Rights Which He Had Lost By It. For He Neither Disposed Of Anything In The Way Of Gift, Nor Manumitted A Slave; Nor So Much As Received Any Estate Left Him By Will, Nor Any Legacy, Without Reckoning It As A Part Of His Peculium Or Property Held Under His Father. From That Day Forward, Nothing Was Omitted That Might Contribute To The Advancement Of His Grandeur, And Much More, When, Upon Agrippa Being Discarded And Banished, It Was Evident That The Hope Of Succession Rested Upon Him Alone.</a> <span class="flex">433</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="434">Xvi. The Tribunitian Authority Was Again Conferred Upon Him For Five Years , And A Commission Given Him To Settle The Affairs Of Germany. The Ambassadors Of The Parthians, After Having Had An Audience Of Augustus, Were Ordered To Apply To Him Likewise In His Province. But On Receiving Intelligence Of An Insurrection In Illyricum , He Went Over To Superintend The Management Of That New War, Which Proved The Most Serious Of All The Foreign Wars Since The Carthaginian. This He Conducted During Three Years, With Fifteen Legions And An Equal Number Of Auxiliary Forces, Under Great Difficulties, And An Extreme Scarcity Of Corn. And Though He Was Several Times Recalled, He Nevertheless Persisted; Fearing Lest An Enemy So Powerful, And So Near, Should Fall Upon The Army In Their Retreat. This Resolution Was Attended With Good Success; For He At Last Reduced To Complete Subjection All Illyricum, Lying Between Italy And The Kingdom Of Noricum, Thrace, Macedonia, The River Danube, And The Adriatic Gulf.</a> <span class="flex">434</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="435">Xvii. The Glory He Acquired By These Successes Received An Increase From The Conjuncture In Which They Happened. For Almost About That Very Time  Quintilius Varus Was Cut Off With Three Legions In Germany; And It Was Generally Believed That The Victorious Germans Would Have Joined The Pannonians, Had Not The War Of Illyricum Been Previously Concluded. A Triumph, Therefore, Besides Many Other Great Honours, Was Decreed Him. Some Proposed That The Surname Of “Pannonicus,” Others That Of “Invincible,” And Others, Of “O Pius,” Should Be Conferred On Him; But Augustus Interposed, Engaging For Him That He Would Be Satisfied With That To Which He Would Succeed At His Death. He Postponed His Triumph, Because  The State Was At That Time Under Great Affliction For The Disaster Of Varus And His Army. Nevertheless, He Entered The City In A Triumphal Robe, Crowned With Laurel, And Mounting A Tribunal In The Septa, Sat With Augustus Between The Two Consuls, Whilst The Senate Gave Their Attendance Standing; Whence, After He Had Saluted The People, He Was Attended By Them In Procession To The Several Temples.</a> <span class="flex">435</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="436">Xviii. Next Year He Went Again To Germany, Where Finding That The Defeat Of Varus Was Occasioned By The Rashness And Negligence Of The Commander, He Thought Proper To Be Guided In Everything By The Advice Of A Council Of War; Whereas, At Other Times, He Used To Follow The Dictates Of His Own Judgment, And Considered Himself Alone As Sufficiently Qualified For The Direction Of Affairs. He Likewise Used More Cautions Than Usual. Having To Pass The Rhine, He Restricted The Whole Convoy Within Certain Limits, And Stationing Himself On The Bank Of The River, Would Not Suffer The Waggons To Cross The River, Until He Had Searched Them At The Water-side, To See That They Carried Nothing But What Was Allowed Or Necessary. Beyond The Rhine, Such Was His Way Of Living, That He Took His Meals Sitting On The Bare Ground , And Often Passed The Night Without A Tent; And His Regular Orders For The Day, As Well As Those Upon Sudden Emergencies, He Gave In Writing, With This Injunction, That In Case Of Any Doubt As To The Meaning Of Them, They Should Apply To Him For Satisfaction, Even At Any Hour Of The Night.</a> <span class="flex">436</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="437">Xix. He Maintained The Strictest Discipline Amongst The Troops; Reviving Many Old Customs Relative To Punishing And Degrading Offenders; Setting A Mark Of Disgrace Even Upon The Commander Of A Legion, For Sending A Few Soldiers With One Of His Freedmen Across The River For The Purpose Of Hunting. Though It Was His Desire To Leave As Little As Possible In The Power Of Fortune Or Accident, Yet He Always Engaged The Enemy With More Confidence When, In His Night-watches, The Lamp Failed And Went Out Of Itself; Trusting, As He Said, In An Omen Which Had Never Failed Him And His Ancestors  In All Their Commands. But, In The Midst Of Victory, He Was Very Near Being Assassinated By Some Bructerian, Who Mixing With Those About Him, And Being Discovered By His Trepidation, Was Put To The Torture, And Confessed His Intended Crime.</a> <span class="flex">437</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="438">Xx. After Two Years, He Returned From Germany To The City, And Celebrated The Triumph Which He Had Deferred, Attended By His Lieutenants, For Whom He Had Procured The Honour Of Triumphal Ornaments . Before He Turned To Ascend The Capitol, He Alighted From His Chariot, And Knelt Before His Father, Who Sat By, To Superintend The Solemnity. Bato, The Pannonian Chief, He Sent To Ravenna, Loaded With Rich Presents, In Gratitude For His Having Suffered Him And His Army To Retire From A Position In Which He Had So Enclosed Them, That They Were Entirely At His Mercy. He Afterwards Gave The People A Dinner At A Thousand Tables, Besides Thirty Sesterces To Each Man. He Likewise Dedicated The Temple Of Concord , And That Of Castor And Pollux, Which Had Been Erected Out Of The Spoils Of The War, In His Own And His Brother’s Name.</a> <span class="flex">438</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="439">Xxi. A Law Having Been Not Long After Carried By The Consuls  For His Being Appointed A Colleague With Augustus In The Administration Of The Provinces, And In Taking The Census, When That Was Finished He Went Into Illyricum . But Being Hastily Recalled During His Journey, He Found Augustus Alive Indeed, But Past All Hopes Of Recovery, And Was With Him In Private A Whole Day. I Know, It Is Generally Believed, That Upon Tiberius’s Quitting The Room, After Their Private Conference, Those Who Were In Waiting Overheard Augustus Say, “Ah! Unhappy Roman People, To Be Ground By The Jaws Of Such A Slow Devourer!” Nor Am I Ignorant Of Its Being Reported By Some, That Augustus So Openly And Undisguisedly Condemned The Sourness Of His Temper, That Sometimes, Upon His Coming In, He Would Break Off Any Jocular Conversation In Which He Was Engaged; And That He Was Only Prevailed Upon By The  Most Gallant Man, And Accomplished General.” Again. “The Disposition Of Your Summer Quarters? In Truth, My Dear Tiberius, I Do Not Think, That Amidst So Many Difficulties, And With An Army So Little Disposed For Action, Any One Could Have Behaved More Prudently Than You Have Done. All Those Likewise Who Were With You, Acknowledge That This Verse Is Applicable To You:”</a> <span class="flex">439</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="442">Xxii. He Did Not Make The Death Of Augustus Public, Until He Had Taken Off Young Agrippa. He Was Slain By A Tribune Who Commanded His Guard, Upon Reading A Written Order For That Purpose: Respecting Which Order, It Was Then A Doubt, Whether Augustus Left It In His Last Moments, To Prevent Any Occasion Of Public Disturbance After His Decease, Or Livia Issued It, In The Name Of Augustus; And Whether With The Knowledge Of Tiberius Or Not. When The Tribune Came To Inform Him That He Had Executed His Command, He Replied, “I Commanded You No Such Thing, And You Must Answer For It To The Senate;” Avoiding, As It Seems, The Odium Of The Act For That Time. And The Affair Was Soon Buried In Silence.</a> <span class="flex">442</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="443">Xxiii. Having Summoned The Senate To Meet By Virtue Of His Tribunitian Authority, And Begun A Mournful Speech, He Drew A Deep Sigh, As If Unable To Support Himself Under His Affliction; And Wishing That Not His Voice Only, But His Very Breath Of Life, Might Fail Him, Gave His Speech To His Son Drusus To Read. Augustus’s Will Was Then Brought In, And Read By A Freedman; None Of The Witnesses To It Being Admitted, But Such As Were Of The Senatorian Order, The Rest Owning Their Hand-writing Without Doors. The Will Began Thus: “Since My Ill-fortune Has Deprived Me Of My Two Sons, Caius And Lucius, Let Tiberius Caesar Be Heir To Two-thirds Of My Estate.” These Words Countenanced The Suspicion Of Those Who Were Of Opinion, That Tiberius Was Appointed Successor More Out Of Necessity Than Choice, Since Augustus Could Not Refrain From Prefacing His Will In That Manner.</a> <span class="flex">443</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="444">Xxiv. Though He Made No Scruple To Assume And Exercise Immediately The Imperial Authority, By Giving Orders That He  Should Be Attended By The Guards, Who Were The Security And Badge Of The Supreme Power; Yet He Affected, By A Most Impudent Piece Of Acting, To Refuse It For A Long Time; One While Sharply Reprehending His Friends Who Entreated Him To Accept It, As Little Knowing What A Monster The Government Was; Another While Keeping In Suspense The Senate, When They Implored Him And Threw Themselves At His Feet, By Ambiguous Answers, And A Crafty Kind Of Dissimulation; Insomuch That Some Were Out Of Patience, And One Cried Out, During The Confusion, “Either Let Him Accept It, Or Decline It At Once;” And A Second Told Him To His Face, “Others Are Slow To Perform What They Promise, But You Are Slow To Promise What You Actually Perform.” At Last, As If Forced To It, And Complaining Of The Miserable And Burdensome Service Imposed Upon Him, He Accepted The Government; Not, However, Without Giving Hopes Of His Resigning It Some Time Or Other. The Exact Words He Used Were These: “Until The Time Shall Come, When Ye May Think It Reasonable To Give Some Rest To My Old Age.”</a> <span class="flex">444</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="445">Xxv. The Cause Of His Long Demur Was Fear Of The Dangers Which Threatened Him On All Hands; Insomuch That He Said, “I Have Got A Wolf By The Ears.” For A Slave Of Agrippa’s, Clemens By Name, Had Drawn Together A Considerable Force To Revenge His Master’s Death; Lucius Scribonius Libo, A Senator Of The First Distinction, Was Secretly Fomenting A Rebellion; And The Troops Both In Illyricum And Germany Were Mutinous. Both Armies Insisted Upon High Demands, Particularly That Their Pay Should Be Made Equal To That Of The Pretorian Guards. The Army In Germany Absolutely Refused To Acknowledge A Prince Who Was Not Their Own Choice; And Urged, With All Possible Importunity, Germanicus , Who Commanded Them, To Take The Government On Himself, Though He Obstinately Refused It. It Was Tiberius’s Apprehension From This Quarter, Which Made Him Request The Senate To Assign Him Some Part Only In The Administration, Such As They Should Judge Proper, Since No Man Could Be Sufficient For The Whole, Without One Or More To Assist Him. He Pretended Likewise To Be In A Bad State Of Health, That Germanicus Might The More Patiently Wait In Hopes Of Speedily Succeeding Him, Or At Least Of Being  Admitted To Be A Colleague In The Government. When The Mutinies In The Armies Were Suppressed, He Got Clemens Into His Hands By Stratagem. That He Might Not Begin His Reign By An Act Of Severity, He Did Not Call Libo To An Account Before The Senate Until His Second Year, Being Content, In The Mean Time, With Taking Proper Precautions For His Own Security. For Upon Libo’s Attending A Sacrifice Amongst The High-priests, Instead Of The Usual Knife, He Ordered One Of Lead To Be Given Him; And When He Desired A Private Conference With Him, He Would Not Grant His Request, But On Condition That His Son Drusus Should Be Present; And As They Walked Together, He Held Him Fast By The Right Hand, Under The Pretence Of Leaning Upon Him, Until The Conversation Was Over.</a> <span class="flex">445</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="446">Xxvi. When He Was Delivered From His Apprehensions, His Behaviour At First Was Unassuming, And He Did Not Carry Himself Much Above The Level Of A Private Person; And Of The Many And Great Honours Offered Him, He Accepted But Few, And Such As Were Very Moderate. His Birth-day, Which Happened To Fall At The Time Of The Plebeian Circensian Games, He With Difficulty Suffered To Be Honoured With The Addition Of Only A Single Chariot, Drawn By Two Horses. He Forbad Temples, Flamens, Or Priests To Be Appointed For Him, As Likewise The Erection Of Any Statues Or Effigies For Him, Without His Permission; And This He Granted Only On Condition That They Should Not Be Placed Amongst The Images Of The Gods, But Only Amongst The Ornaments Of Houses. He Also Interposed To Prevent The Senate From Swearing To Maintain His Acts; And The Month Of September From Being Called Tiberius, And October Being Named After Livia. The Praenomen Likewise Of Emperor, With The Cognomen Of Father Of His Country, And A Civic Crown In The Vestibule Of His House, He Would Not Accept. He Never Used The Name Of Augustus, Although He Inherited It, In Any Of His Letters, Excepting Those Addressed To Kings And Princes. Nor Had He More Than Three Consulships; One For A Few Days, Another For Three Months, And A Third, During His Absence From The City, Until The Ides [Fifteenth] Of May.</a> <span class="flex">446</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="447">Xxvii. He Had Such An Aversion To Flattery, That He Would Never Suffer Any Senator To Approach His Litter, As He Passed The Streets In It, Either To Pay Him A Civility, Or Upon Business.  And When A Man Of Consular Rank, In Begging His Pardon For Some Offence He Had Given Him, Attempted To Fall At His Feet, He Started From Him In Such Haste, That He Stumbled And Fell. If Any Compliment Was Paid Him, Either In Conversation Or A Set Speech, He Would Not Scruple To Interrupt And Reprimand The Party, And Alter What He Had Said. Being Once Called “Lord,”  By Some Person, He Desired That He Might No More Be Affronted In That Manner. When Another, To Excite Veneration, Called His Occupations “Sacred,” And A Third Had Expressed Himself Thus: “By Your Authority I Have Waited Upon The Senate,” He Obliged Them To Change Their Phrases; In One Of Them Adopting Persuasion, Instead Of “Authority,” And In The Other, Laborious, Instead Of “Sacred.”</a> <span class="flex">447</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="448">Xxviii. He Remained Unmoved At All The Aspersions, Scandalous Reports, And Lampoons, Which Were Spread Against Him Or His Relations; Declaring, “In A Free State, Both The Tongue And The Mind Ought To Be Free.” Upon The Senate’s Desiring That Some Notice Might Be Taken Of Those Offences, And The Persons Charged With Them, He Replied, “We Have Not So Much Time Upon Our Hands, That We Ought To Involve Ourselves In More Business. If You Once Make An Opening  For Such Proceedings, You Will Soon Have Nothing Else To Do. All Private Quarrels Will Be Brought Before You Under That Pretence.” There Is Also On Record Another Sentence Used By Him In The Senate, Which Is Far From Assuming: “If He Speaks Otherwise Of Me, I Shall Take Care To Behave In Such A Manner, As To Be Able To Give A Good Account Both Of My Words And Actions; And If He Persists, I Shall Hate Him In My Turn.”</a> <span class="flex">448</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="449">Xxix. These Things Were So Much The More Remarkable In Him, Because, In The Respect He Paid To Individuals, Or The Whole Body Of The Senate, He Went Beyond All Bounds. Upon His Differing With Quintus Haterius In The Senate-house, “Pardon Me, Sir,” He Said, “I Beseech You, If I Shall, As A Senator, Speak My Mind Very Freely In Opposition To You.” Afterwards, Addressing The Senate In General, He Said: “Conscript Fathers, I Have Often Said It Both Now And At Other Times, That A Good  And Useful Prince, Whom You Have Invested With So Great And Absolute Power, Ought To Be A Slave To The Senate, To The Whole Body Of The People, And Often To Individuals Likewise: Nor Am I Sorry That I Have Said It. I Have Always Found You Good, Kind, And Indulgent Masters, And Still Find You So.”</a> <span class="flex">449</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="450">Xxx. He Likewise Introduced A Certain Show Of Liberty, By Preserving To The Senate And Magistrates Their Former Majesty And Power. All Affairs, Whether Of Great Or Small Importance, Public Or Private, Were Laid Before The Senate. Taxes And Monopolies, The Erecting Or Repairing Edifices, Levying And Disbanding Soldiers, The Disposal Of The Legions And Auxiliary Forces In The Provinces, The Appointment Of Generals For The Management Of Extraordinary Wars, And The Answers To Letters From Foreign Princes, Were All Submitted To The Senate. He Compelled The Commander Of A Troop Of Horse, Who Was Accused Of Robbery Attended With Violence, To Plead His Cause Before The Senate. He Never Entered The Senate-house But Unattended; And Being Once Brought Thither In A Litter, Because He Was Indisposed, He Dismissed His Attendants At The Door.</a> <span class="flex">450</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="451">Xxxi. When Some Decrees Were Made Contrary To His Opinion, He Did Not Even Make Any Complaint. And Though He Thought That No Magistrates After Their Nomination Should Be Allowed To Absent Themselves From The City, But Reside In It Constantly, To Receive Their Honours In Person, A Praetor-elect Obtained Liberty To Depart Under The Honorary Title Of A Legate At Large. Again, When He Proposed To The Senate, That The Trebians Might Have Leave Granted Them To Divert Some Money Which Had Been Left Them By Will For The Purpose Of Building A New Theatre, To That Of Making A Road, He Could Not Prevail To Have The Will Of The Testator Set Aside. And When, Upon A Division Of The House, He Went Over To The Minority, Nobody Followed Him. All Other Things Of A Public Nature Were Likewise Transacted By The Magistrates, And In The Usual Forms; The Authority Of The Consuls Remaining So Great, That Some Ambassadors From Africa Applied To Them, And Complained, That They Could Not Have Their Business Dispatched By Caesar, To Whom They Had Been Sent. And No Wonder; Since It Was Observed That He Used To Rise Up As The Consuls Approached, And Give Them The Way.</a> <span class="flex">451</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="454">Xxxiii. He Assumed The Sovereignty  By Slow Degrees, And Exercised It For A Long Time With Great Variety Of Conduct, Though Generally With A Due Regard To The Public Good. At First He Only Interposed To Prevent Ill Management. Accordingly, He Rescinded Some Decrees Of The Senate; And When The Magistrates Sat For The Administration Of Justice, He Frequently Offered His Service As Assessor, Either Taking His Place Promiscuously Amongst Them, Or Seating Himself In A Corner Of The Tribunal. If A Rumour Prevailed, That Any Person Under Prosecution Was Likely To Be Acquitted By His Interest, He Would Suddenly Make His Appearance, And From The Floor Of The Court,  Or The Praetor’s Bench, Remind The Judges Of The Laws, And Of Their Oaths, And The Nature Of The Charge Brought Before Them, He Likewise Took Upon Himself The Correction Of Public Morals, Where They Tended To Decay, Either Through Neglect, Or Evil Custom.</a> <span class="flex">454</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="455">Xxxiv. He Reduced The Expense Of The Plays And Public Spectacles, By Diminishing The Allowances To Actors, And Curtailing The Number Of Gladiators. He Made Grievous Complaints To The Senate, That The Price Of Corinthian Vessels Was Become Enormous, And That Three Mullets Had Been Sold For Thirty Thousand Sesterces: Upon Which He Proposed That A New Sumptuary Law Should Be Enacted; That The Butchers And Other Dealers In Viands Should Be Subject To An Assize, Fixed By The Senate Yearly; And The Aediles Commissioned To Restrain Eating-houses And Taverns, So Far As Not Even To Permit The Sale Of Any Kind Of Pastry. And To Encourage Frugality In The Public By His Own Example, He Would Often, At His Solemn Feasts, Have At His Tables Victuals Which Had Been Served Up The Day Before, And Were Partly Eaten, And Half A Boar, Affirming, “It Has All The Same Good Bits That The Whole Had.” He Published An Edict Against The Practice Of People’s Kissing Each Other When They Met; And Would Not Allow New-year’s Gifts  To Be Presented After The Calends [The First] Of January Was Passed. He Had Been In The Habit Of Returning These Offerings Four-fold, And Making Them With His Own Hand; But Being Annoyed By The Continual Interruption To Which He Was Exposed During The Whole Month, By Those Who Had Not The Opportunity Of Attending Him On The Festival, He Returned None After That Day.</a> <span class="flex">455</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="456">Xxxv. Married Women Guilty Of Adultery, Though Not Prosecuted Publicly, He Authorised The Nearest Relations To Punish By Agreement Among Themselves, According To Ancient Custom. He Discharged A Roman Knight From The Obligation Of An Oath He Had Taken, Never To Turn Away His Wife; And Allowed Him To Divorce Her, Upon Her Being Caught In Criminal Intercourse With Her Son-in-law. Women Of Ill-fame, Divesting Themselves Of The Rights And Dignity Of Matrons, Had Now Begun A Practice Of Professing Themselves Prostitutes, To Avoid  The Punishment Of The Laws; And The Most Profligate Young Men Of The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders, To Secure Themselves Against A Decree Of The Senate, Which Prohibited Their Performing On The Stage, Or In The Amphitheatre, Voluntarily Subjected Themselves To An Infamous Sentence, By Which They Were Degraded. All Those He Banished, That None For The Future Might Evade By Such Artifices The Intention And Efficacy Of The Law. He Stripped A Senator Of The Broad Stripes On His Robe, Upon Information Of His Having Removed To His Gardens Before The Calends [The First] Of July, In Order That He Might Afterwards Hire A House Cheaper In The City. He Likewise Dismissed Another From The Office Of Quaestor, For Repudiating, The Day After He Had Been Lucky In Drawing His Lot, A Wife Whom He Had Married Only The Day Before.</a> <span class="flex">456</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="457">Xxxvi. He Suppressed All Foreign Religions, And The Egyptian  And Jewish Rites, Obliging Those Who Practised That Kind Of Superstition, To Burn Their Vestments, And All Their Sacred Utensils. He Distributed The Jewish Youths, Under The Pretence Of Military Service, Among The Provinces Noted For An Unhealthy Climate; And Dismissed From The City All The Rest Of That Nation As Well As Those Who Were Proselytes To That Religion , Under Pain Of Slavery For Life, Unless They Complied. He Also Expelled The Astrologers; But Upon Their Suing For Pardon, And Promising To Renounce Their Profession, He Revoked His Decree.</a> <span class="flex">457</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="458">Xxxvii.

He Never Set Foot Outside The Gates Of Rome, For Two Years Together, From The Time He Assumed The Supreme Power; And After That Period, Went No Farther From The City Than To Some Of The Neighbouring Towns; His Farthest Excursion Being To Antium , And That But Very Seldom, And For A Few Days; Though He Often Gave Out That He Would Visit The Provinces And Armies, And Made Preparations For It Almost Every Year, By Taking Up Carriages, And Ordering Provisions For His Retinue In The Municipia And Colonies. At Last He Suffered Vows To Be Put Up For His Good Journey And Safe Return, Insomuch That He Was Called Jocosely By The Name Of Callipides, Who Is Famous In A Greek Proverb, For Being In A Great Hurry To Go Forward, But Without Ever Advancing A Cubit.</a> <span class="flex">459</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="460">Xxxix. But After The Loss Of His Two Sons, Of Whom Germanicus Died In Syria, And Drusus At Rome, He Withdrew Into Campania ; At Which Time Opinion And Conversation Were Almost General, That He Never Would Return, And Would Die Soon. And Both Nearly Turned Out To Be True. For Indeed He Never More Came To Rome; And A Few Days After Leaving It, When He Was At A Villa Of His Called The Cave, Near Terracina , During Supper A Great Many Huge Stones Fell From Above, Which Killed Several Of The Guests And Attendants; But He Almost Hopelessly Escaped.</a> <span class="flex">460</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="461">Xl. After He Had Gone Round Campania, And Dedicated The Capitol At Capua, And A Temple To Augustus At Nola , Which He Made The Pretext Of His Journey, He Retired To Capri; Being  Greatly Delighted With The Island, Because It Was Accessible Only By A Narrow Beach, Being On All Sides Surrounded With Rugged Cliffs, Of A Stupendous Height, And By A Deep Sea. But Immediately, The People Of Rome Being Extremely Clamorous For His Return, On Account Of A Disaster At Fidenae , Where Upwards Of Twenty Thousand Persons Had Been Killed By The Fall Of The Amphitheatre, During A Public Spectacle Of Gladiators, He Crossed Over Again To The Continent, And Gave All People Free Access To Him; So Much The More, Because, At His Departure From The City, He Had Caused It To Be Proclaimed That No One Should Address Him, And Had Declined Admitting Any Persons To His Presence, On The Journey.</a> <span class="flex">461</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="462">Xli. Returning To The Island, He So Far Abandoned All Care Of The Government, That He Never Filled Up The Decuriae Of The Knights, Never Changed Any Military Tribunes Or Prefects, Or Governors Of Provinces, And Kept Spain And Syria For Several Years Without Any Consular Lieutenants. He Likewise Suffered Armenia To Be Seized By The Parthians, Moesia By The Dacians And Sarmatians, And Gaul To Be Ravaged By The Germans; To The Great Disgrace, And No Less Danger, Of The Empire.</a> <span class="flex">462</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="463">Xlii. But Having Now The Advantage Of Privacy, And Being Remote From The Observation Of The People Of Rome, He Abandoned Himself To All The Vicious Propensities Which He Had Long But Imperfectly Concealed, And Of Which I Shall Here Give A Particular Account From The Beginning. While A Young Soldier In The Camp, He Was So Remarkable For His Excessive Inclination To Wine, That, For Tiberius, They Called Him Biberius; For Claudius, Caldius; And For Nero, Mero. And After He Succeeded To The Empire, And Was Invested With The Office Of Reforming The Morality Of The People, He Spent A Whole Night And Two Days Together In Feasting And Drinking With Pomponius Flaccus And Lucius Piso; To One Of Whom He Immediately Gave The Province Of Syria, And To The Other The Prefecture Of The City; Declaring Them, In His Letters-patent, To Be “Very Pleasant Companions, And Friends Fit For All Occasions.” He Made An Appointment To Sup With Sestius Gallus, A Lewd And Prodigal Old Fellow, Who Had Been Disgraced By Augustus, And Reprimanded By Himself But A Few Days Before In The Senate-house; Upon Condition That He Should Not Recede In The Least From His Usual Method Of Entertainment, And That They Should Be Attended At Table By Naked Girls. He Preferred A Very Obscure Candidate For The Quaestorship, Before The Most Noble Competitors, Only For Taking Off, In Pledging Him At Table, An Amphora Of Wine At A Draught . He Presented Asellius Sabinus With Two Hundred Thousand Sesterces, For Writing A Dialogue, In The Way Of Dispute, Betwixt The Truffle And The Fig-pecker, The Oyster And The Thrush. He Likewise Instituted A New Office To Administer To His Voluptuousness, To Which He Appointed Titus Caesonius Priscus, A Roman Knight.</a> <span class="flex">463</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="464">Xliii. In His Retreat At Capri , He Also Contrived An Apartment Containing Couches, And Adapted To The Secret Practice Of Abominable Lewdness, Where He Entertained Companies Of Girls And Catamites, And Assembled From All Quarters Inventors Of Unnatural Copulations, Whom He Called Spintriae, Who Defiled One Another In His Presence, To Inflame By The Exhibition The Languid Appetite. He Had Several Chambers Set Round With Pictures And Statues In The Most Lascivious Attitudes, And Furnished With The Books Of Elephantis, That None Might Want A Pattern For The Execution Of Any Lewd Project That Was Prescribed Him. He Likewise Contrived Recesses In Woods And Groves For The Gratification Of Lust, Where Young Persons Of Both Sexes Prostituted Themselves In Caves And Hollow Rocks, In The Disguise Of Little Pans And Nymphs . So That He Was Publicly And Commonly Called, By An Abuse Of The Name Of The Island, Caprineus.</a> <span class="flex">464</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="465">Xliv. But He Was Still More Infamous, If Possible, For An  Abomination Not Fit To Be Mentioned Or Heard, Much Less Credited.  —————————When A Picture, Painted By Parrhasius, In Which The Artist Had Represented Atalanta In The Act Of Submitting To Meleager’s Lust In A Most Unnatural Way, Was Bequeathed To Him, With This Proviso, That If The Subject Was Offensive To Him, He Might Receive In Lieu Of It A Million Of Sesterces, He Not Only Chose The Picture, But Hung It Up In His Bed-chamber. It Is Also Reported That, During A Sacrifice, He Was So Captivated With The Form Of A Youth Who Held A Censer, That, Before The Religious Rites Were Well Over, He Took Him Aside And Abused Him; As Also A Brother Of His Who Had Been Playing The Flute; And Soon Afterwards Broke The Legs Of Both Of Them, For Upbraiding One Another With Their Shame.</a> <span class="flex">465</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="466">Xlv. How Much He Was Guilty Of A Most Foul Intercourse With Women Even Of The First Quality , Appeared Very Plainly By The Death Of One Mallonia, Who, Being Brought To His Bed, But Resolutely Refusing To Comply With His Lust, He Gave Her Up To The Common Informers. Even When She Was Upon Her Trial, He Frequently Called Out To Her, And Asked Her, “Do You Repent?” Until She, Quitting The Court, Went Home, And Stabbed Herself; Openly Upbraiding The Vile Old Lecher For His Gross Obscenity . Hence There Was An Allusion To Him In A Farce, Which Was Acted At The Next Public Sports, And Was Received With Great Applause, And Became A Common Topic Of Ridicule : That The Old Goat————</a> <span class="flex">466</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="467">Xlvi. He Was So Niggardly And Covetous, That He Never Allowed To His Attendants, In His Travels And Expeditions, Any Salary, But Their Diet Only. Once, Indeed, He Treated Them Liberally, At The Instigation Of His Step-father, When, Dividing Them Into Three Classes, According To Their Rank, He Gave The  First Six, The Second Four, And The Third Two, Hundred Thousand Sesterces, Which Last Class He Called Not Friends, But Greeks.</a> <span class="flex">467</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="468">Xlvii. During The Whole Time Of His Government, He Never Erected Any Noble Edifice; For The Only Things He Did Undertake, Namely, Building The Temple Of Augustus, And Restoring Pompey’s Theatre, He Left At Last, After Many Years, Unfinished. Nor Did He Ever Entertain The People With Public Spectacles; And He Was Seldom Present At Those Which Were Given By Others, Lest Any Thing Of That Kind Should Be Requested Of Him; Especially After He Was Obliged To Give Freedom To The Comedian Actius. Having Relieved The Poverty Of A Few Senators, To Avoid Further Demands, He Declared That He Should For The Future Assist None, But Those Who Gave The Senate Full Satisfaction As To The Cause Of Their Necessity. Upon This, Most Of The Needy Senators, From Modesty And Shame, Declined Troubling Him. Amongst These Was Hortalus, Grandson To The Celebrated Orator Quintus Hortensius, Who [Marrying], By The Persuasion Of Augustus, Had Brought Up Four Children Upon A Very Small Estate.</a> <span class="flex">468</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="469">Xlviii. He Displayed Only Two Instances Of Public Munificence. One Was An Offer To Lend Gratis, For Three Years, A Hundred Millions Of Sesterces To Those Who Wanted To Borrow; And The Other, When, Some Large Houses Being Burnt Down Upon Mount Caelius, He Indemnified The Owners. To The Former Of These He Was Compelled By The Clamours Of The People, In A Great Scarcity Of Money, When He Had Ratified A Decree Of The Senate Obliging All Money-lenders To Advance Two-thirds Of Their Capital On Land, And The Debtors To Pay Off At Once The Same Proportion Of Their Debts, And It Was Found Insufficient To Remedy The Grievance. The Other He Did To Alleviate In Some Degree The Pressure Of The Times. But His Benefaction To The Sufferers By Fire, He Estimated At So High A Rate, That He Ordered The Caelian Hill To Be Called, In Future, The Augustan. To The Soldiery, After Doubling The Legacy Left Them By Augustus, He Never Gave Any Thing, Except A Thousand Denarii A Man To The Pretorian Guards, For Not Joining The Party Of Sejanus; And Some Presents To The Legions In Syria, Because They Alone Had Not Paid Reverence To The Effigies Of Sejanus Among Their Standards. He Seldom Gave Discharges To The Veteran Soldiers, Calculating  On Their Deaths From Advanced Age, And On What Would Be Saved By Thus Getting Rid Of Them, In The Way Of Rewards Or Pensions. Nor Did He Ever Relieve The Provinces By Any Act Of Generosity, Excepting Asia, Where Some Cities Had Been Destroyed By An Earthquake.</a> <span class="flex">469</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="470">Xlix. In The Course Of A Very Short Time, He Turned His Mind To Sheer Robbery. It Is Certain That Cneius Lentulus, The Augur, A Man Of Vast Estate, Was So Terrified And Worried By His Threats And Importunities, That He Was Obliged To Make Him His Heir; And That Lepida, A Lady Of A Very Noble Family, Was Condemned By Him, In Order To Gratify Quirinus, A Man Of Consular Rank, Extremely Rich, And Childless, Who Had Divorced Her Twenty Years Before, And Now Charged Her With An Old Design To Poison Him. Several Persons, Likewise, Of The First Distinction In Gaul, Spain, Syria, And Greece, Had Their Estates Confiscated Upon Such Despicably Trifling And Shameless Pretences, That Against Some Of Them No Other Charge Was Preferred, Than That They Held Large Sums Of Ready Money As Part Of Their Property. Old Immunities, The Rights Of Mining, And Of Levying Tolls, Were Taken From Several Cities And Private Persons. And Vonones, King Of The Parthians, Who Had Been Driven Out Of His Dominions By His Own Subjects, And Fled To Antioch With A Vast Treasure, Claiming The Protection Of The Roman People, His Allies, Was Treacherously Robbed Of All His Money, And Afterwards Murdered.</a> <span class="flex">470</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="471">L. He First Manifested Hatred Towards His Own Relations In The Case Of His Brother Drusus, Betraying Him By The Production Of A Letter To Himself, In Which Drusus Proposed That Augustus Should Be Forced To Restore The Public Liberty. In Course Of Time, He Shewed The Same Disposition With Regard To The Rest Of His Family. So Far Was He From Performing Any Office Of Kindness Or Humanity To His Wife, When She Was Banished, And, By Her Father’s Order, Confined To One Town, That He Forbad Her To Stir Out Of The House, Or Converse With Any Men. He Even Wronged Her Of The Dowry Given Her By Her Father, And Of Her Yearly Allowance, By A Quibble Of Law, Because Augustus Had Made No Provision For Them On Her Behalf In His Will. Being Harassed By His Mother, Livia, Who Claimed An Equal Share In The Government With Him, He Frequently Avoided  Seeing Her, And All Long And Private Conferences With Her, Lest It Should Be Thought That He Was Governed By Her Counsels, Which, Notwithstanding, He Sometimes Sought, And Was In The Habit Of Adopting. He Was Much Offended At The Senate, When They Proposed To Add To His Other Titles That Of The Son Of Livia, As Well As Augustus. He, Therefore, Would Not Suffer Her To Be Called “The Mother Of Her Country,” Nor To Receive Any Extraordinary Public Distinction. Nay, He Frequently Admonished Her “Not To Meddle With Weighty Affairs, And Such As Did Not Suit Her Sex;” Especially When He Found Her Present At A Fire Which Broke Out Near The Temple Of Vesta , And Encouraging The People And Soldiers To Use Their Utmost Exertions, As She Had Been Used To Do In The Time Of Her Husband.</a> <span class="flex">471</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="472">Li. He Afterwards Proceeded To An Open Rupture With Her, And, As Is Said, Upon This Occasion. She Having Frequently Urged Him To Place Among The Judges A Person Who Had Been Made Free Of The City, He Refused Her Request, Unless She Would Allow It To Be Inscribed On The Roll, “That The Appointment Had Been Extorted From Him By His Mother.” Enraged At This, Livia Brought Forth From Her Chapel Some Letters From Augustus To Her, Complaining Of The Sourness And Insolence Of Tiberius’s Temper, And These She Read. So Much Was He Offended At These Letters Having Been Kept So Long, And Now Produced With So Much Bitterness Against Him, That Some Considered This Incident As One Of The Causes Of His Going Into Seclusion, If Not The Principal Reason For His So Doing. In The  Whole Years She Lived During His Retirement, He Saw Her But Once, And That For A Few Hours Only. When She Fell Sick Shortly Afterwards, He Was Quite Unconcerned About Visiting Her In Her Illness; And When She Died, After Promising To Attend Her Funeral, He Deferred His Coming For Several Days, So That The Corpse Was In A State Of Decay And Putrefaction Before The Interment; And He Then Forbad Divine Honours Being Paid To Her, Pretending That He Acted According To Her Own Directions. He Likewise Annulled Her Will, And In A Short Time Ruined All Her Friends And Acquaintance; Not Even Sparing Those To Whom, On Her Death-bed, She Had Recommended The Care Of Her Funeral, But Condemning One Of Them, A Man Of Equestrian Rank, To The Treadmill.</a> <span class="flex">472</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="473">Lii. He Entertained No Paternal Affection Either For His Own Son Drusus, Or His Adopted Son Germanicus. Offended At The Vices Of The Former, Who Was Of A Loose Disposition And Led A Dissolute Life, He Was Not Much Affected At His Death; But, Almost Immediately After The Funeral, Resumed His Attention To Business, And Prevented The Courts From Being Longer Closed. The Ambassadors From The People Of Ilium Coming Rather Late To Offer Their Condolence, He Said To Them By Way Of Banter, As If The Affair Had Already Faded From His Memory, “And I Heartily Condole With You On The Loss Of Your Renowned Countryman, Hector.” He So Much Affected To Depreciate Germanicus, That He Spoke Of His Achievements As Utterly Insignificant, And Railed At His Most Glorious Victories As Ruinous To The State; Complaining Of Him Also To The Senate For Going To Alexandria Without His Knowledge, Upon Occasion Of A Great And Sudden Famine At Rome. It Was Believed That He Took Care To Have Him Dispatched By Cneius Piso, His Lieutenant In Syria. This Person Was Afterwards Tried For The Murder, And Would, As Was Supposed, Have Produced His Orders, Had They Not Been Contained In A Private And Confidential Dispatch. The Following Words Therefore Were Posted Up In Many Places, And Frequently Shouted In The Night: “Give Us Back Our Germanicus.” This Suspicion Was Afterwards Confirmed By The Barbarous Treatment Of His Wife And Children.</a> <span class="flex">473</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="476">Liv. He Had By Germanicus Three Grandsons, Nero, Drusus, And Caius; And By His Son Drusus One, Named Tiberius. Of These, After The Loss Of His Sons, He Commended Nero And Drusus, The Two Eldest Sons Of Germanicus, To The Senate; And At Their Being Solemnly Introduced Into The Forum, Distributed Money Among The People. But When He Found That On Entering Upon The New Year They Were Included In The Public Vows For His Own Welfare, He Told The Senate, “That Such Honours Ought Not To Be Conferred But Upon Those Who Had Been Proved, And Were Of More Advanced Years.” By Thus Betraying His Private Feelings Towards Them, He Exposed Them To All Sorts Of Accusations; And After Practising Many Artifices To Provoke  Them To Rail At And Abuse Him, That He Might Be Furnished With A Pretence To Destroy Them, He Charged Them With It In A Letter To The Senate; At The Same Time Accusing Them, In The Bitterest Terms, Of The Most Scandalous Vices. Upon Their Being Declared Enemies By The Senate, He Starved Them To Death; Nero In The Island Of Ponza, And Drusus In The Vaults Of The Palatium. It Is Thought By Some, That Nero Was Driven To A Voluntary Death By The Executioner’s Shewing Him Some Halters And Hooks, As If He Had Been Sent To Him By Order Of The Senate. Drusus, It Is Said, Was So Rabid With Hunger, That He Attempted To Eat The Chaff With Which His Mattress Was Stuffed. The Relics Of Both Were So Scattered, That It Was With Difficulty They Were Collected.</a> <span class="flex">476</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="477">Lv. Besides His Old Friends And Intimate Acquaintance, He Required The Assistance Of Twenty Of The Most Eminent Persons In The City, As Counsellors In The Administration Of Public Affairs. Out Of All This Number, Scarcely Two Or Three Escaped The Fury Of His Savage Disposition. All The Rest He Destroyed Upon One Pretence Or Another; And Among Them Aelius Sejanus, Whose Fall Was Attended With The Ruin Of Many Others. He Had Advanced This Minister To The Highest Pitch Of Grandeur, Not So Much From Any Real Regard For Him, As That By His Base And Sinister Contrivances He Might Ruin The Children Of Germanicus, And Thereby Secure The Succession To His Own Grandson By Drusus.</a> <span class="flex">477</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="478">Lvi. He Treated With No Greater Leniency The Greeks In His Family, Even Those With Whom He Was Most Pleased. Having Asked One Zeno, Upon His Using Some Far-fetched Phrases, “What Uncouth Dialect Is That?” He Replied, “The Doric.” For This Answer He Banished Him To Cinara , Suspecting That He Taunted Him With His Former Residence At Rhodes, Where The Doric Dialect Is Spoken. It Being His Custom To Start Questions At Supper, Arising Out Of What He Had Been Reading In The Day, And Finding That Seleucus, The Grammarian, Used To Inquire Of His Attendants What Authors He Was Then Studying, And So Came Prepared For His Enquiries—he First Turned Him Out Of His Family, And Then Drove Him To The Extremity Of Laying Violent Hands Upon Himself.</a> <span class="flex">478</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="481">Lviii. About The Same Time, When The Praetor Consulted Him, Whether It Was His Pleasure That The Tribunals Should Take Cognizance Of Accusations Of Treason, He Replied, “The Laws Ought To Be Put In Execution;” And He Did Put Them In Execution Most Severely. Some Person Had Taken Off The Head Of Augustus From One Of His Statues, And Replaced It By Another . The Matter Was Brought Before The Senate, And Because The Case Was Not Clear, The Witnesses Were Put To The Torture. The Party Accused Being Found Guilty, And Condemned, This Kind Of Proceeding Was Carried So Far, That It Became Capital For A Man To Beat His Slave, Or Change His Clothes, Near The Statue Of Augustus; To Carry His Head Stamped Upon The Coin, Or Cut In The Stone Of A Ring, Into A Necessary House, Or The Stews; Or To Reflect Upon Anything That Had Been Either Said Or Done By Him. In Fine, A Person Was Condemned To Death, For Suffering Some Honours To Be Decreed To Him In The Colony Where He Lived, Upon The Same Day On Which They Had Formerly Been Decreed To Augustus.</a> <span class="flex">481</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="486">Lxi. Soon Afterwards, He Abandoned Himself To Every Species Of Cruelty, Never Wanting Occasions Of One Kind Or Another, To Serve As A Pretext. He First Fell Upon The Friends And Acquaintance Of His Mother, Then Those Of His Grandsons, And His Daughter-in-law, And Lastly Those Of Sejanus; After Whose Death He Became Cruel In The Extreme. From This It Appeared, That He Had Not Been So Much Instigated By Sejanus, As Supplied With Occasions Of Gratifying His Savage Temper, When He Wanted Them. Though In A Short Memoir Which He Composed Of His Own Life, He Had The Effrontery To Write, “I Have Punished Sejanus, Because I Found Him Bent Upon The Destruction Of The Children Of My Son Germanicus,” One Of These He Put To Death, When He Began To Suspect Sejanus; And Another, After He Was Taken Off. It Would Be Tedious To Relate All The Numerous Instances Of His Cruelty: Suffice It To Give A Few Examples, In Their Different Kinds. Not A Day Passed Without The Punishment Of Some Person Or Other, Not Excepting Holidays, Or Those Appropriated To The Worship Of The Gods. Some Were Tried Even On New-year’s-day. Of Many Who Were Condemned, Their Wives And Children Shared The Same Fate; And For Those Who Were Sentenced To Death, The Relations Were Forbid To Put On Mourning. Considerable Rewards Were Voted For The Prosecutors, And Sometimes For The Witnesses Also. The Information Of Any Person, Without Exception, Was Taken; And All Offences Were Capital, Even Speaking  A Few Words, Though Without Any Ill Intention. A Poet Was Charged With Abusing Agamemnon; And A Historian , For Calling Brutus And Cassius “The Last Of The Romans.” The Two Authors Were Immediately Called To Account, And Their Writings Suppressed; Though They Had Been Well Received Some Years Before, And Read In The Hearing Of Augustus. Some, Who Were Thrown Into Prison, Were Not Only Denied The Solace Of Study, But Debarred From All Company And Conversation. Many Persons, When Summoned To Trial, Stabbed Themselves At Home, To Avoid The Distress And Ignominy Of A Public Condemnation, Which They Were Certain Would Ensue. Others Took Poison In The Senate House. The Wounds Were Bound Up, And All Who Had Not Expired, Were Carried, Half-dead, And Panting For Life, To Prison. Those Who Were Put To Death, Were Thrown Down The Gemonian Stairs, And Then Dragged Into The Tiber. In One Day, Twenty Were Treated In This Manner; And Amongst Them Women And Boys. Because, According To An Ancient Custom, It Was Not Lawful To Strangle Virgins, The Young Girls Were First Deflowered By The Executioner, And Afterwards Strangled. Those Who Were Desirous To Die, Were Forced To Live. For He Thought Death So Slight A Punishment, That Upon Hearing That Carnulius, One Of The Accused, Who Was Under Prosecution, Had Killed Himself, He Exclaimed, “Carnulius Has Escaped Me.” In Calling Over His Prisoners, When One Of Them Requested The Favour Of A Speedy Death, He Replied, “You Are Not Yet Restored To Favour.” A Man Of Consular Rank Writes In His Annals, That At Table, Where He Himself Was Present With A Large Company, He Was Suddenly Asked Aloud By A Dwarf Who Stood By Amongst The Buffoons, Why Paconius, Who Was Under A Prosecution For Treason, Lived So Long. Tiberius Immediately Reprimanded Him For His Pertness; But Wrote To The Senate A Few Days After, To Proceed Without Delay To The Punishment Of Paconius.</a> <span class="flex">486</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="487">Lxii. Exasperated By Information He Received Respecting The Death Of His Son Drusus, He Carried His Cruelty Still Farther. He Imagined That He Had Died Of A Disease Occasioned  By His Intemperance; But Finding That He Had Been Poisoned By The Contrivance Of His Wife Livilla  And Sejanus, He Spared No One From Torture And Death. He Was So Entirely Occupied With The Examination Of This Affair, For Whole Days Together, That, Upon Being Informed That The Person In Whose House He Had Lodged At Rhodes, And Whom He Had By A Friendly Letter Invited To Rome, Was Arrived, He Ordered Him Immediately To Be Put To The Torture, As A Party Concerned In The Enquiry. Upon Finding His Mistake, He Commanded Him To Be Put To Death, That He Might Not Publish The Injury Done Him. The Place Of Execution Is Still Shown At Capri, Where He Ordered Those Who Were Condemned To Die, After Long And Exquisite Tortures, To Be Thrown, Before His Eyes, From A Precipice Into The Sea. There A Party Of Soldiers Belonging To The Fleet Waited For Them, And Broke Their Bones With Poles And Oars, Lest They Should Have Any Life Left In Them. Among Various Kinds Of Torture Invented By Him, One Was, To Induce People To Drink A Large Quantity Of Wine, And Then To Tie Up Their Members With Harp-strings, Thus Tormenting Them At Once By The Tightness Of The Ligature, And The Stoppage Of Their Urine. Had Not Death Prevented Him, And Thrasyllus, Designedly, As Some Say, Prevailed With Him To Defer Some Of His Cruelties, In Hopes Of Longer Life, It Is Believed That He Would Have Destroyed Many More: And Not Have Spared Even The Rest Of His Grandchildren: For He Was Jealous Of Caius, And Hated Tiberius As Having Been Conceived In Adultery. This Conjecture Is Indeed Highly Probable; For He Used Often To Say, “Happy Priam, Who Survived All His Children!”</a> <span class="flex">487</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="488">Lxiii. Amidst These Enormities, In How Much Fear And Apprehension, As Well As Odium And Detestation, He Lived, Is Evident From Many Indications. He Forbade The Soothsayers To Be Consulted In Private, And Without Some Witnesses Being Present. He Attempted To Suppress The Oracles In The Neighbourhood Of The City; But Being Terrified By The Divine Authority Of The  Praenestine Lots , He Abandoned The Design. For Though They Were Sealed Up In A Box, And Carried To Home, Yet They Were Not To Be Found In It, Until It Was Returned To The Temple. More Than One Person Of Consular Rank, Appointed Governors Of Provinces, He Never Ventured To Dismiss To Their Respective Destinations, But Kept Them Until Several Years After, When He Nominated Their Successors, While They Still Remained Present With Him. In The Meantime, They Bore The Title Of Their Office; And He Frequently Gave Them Orders, Which They Took Care To Have Executed By Their Deputies And Assistants.</a> <span class="flex">488</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="489">Lxiv. He Never Removed His Daughter-in-law, Or Grandsons , After Their Condemnation, To Any Place, But In Fetters And In A Covered Litter, With A Guard To Hinder All Who Met Them On The Road, And Travellers, From Stopping To Gaze At Them.</a> <span class="flex">489</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="490">Lxv. After Sejanus Had Plotted Against Him, Though He Saw That His Birth-day Was Solemnly Kept By The Public, And Divine Honours Paid To Golden Images Of Him In Every Quarter, Yet It Was With Difficulty At Last, And More By Artifice Than His Imperial Power, That He Accomplished His Death. In The First Place, To Remove Him From About His Person, Under The Pretext Of Doing Him Honour, He Made Him His Colleague In His Fifth Consulship; Which, Although Then Absent From The City, He Took Upon Him For That Purpose, Long After His Preceding Consulship. Then, Having Flattered Him With The Hope Of An Alliance By Marriage With One Of His Own Kindred, And The Prospect Of The Tribunitian Authority, He Suddenly, While Sejanus Little Expected It, Charged Him With Treason, In An Abject And Pitiful Address To The Senate; In Which, Among Other Things, He Begged Them “To Send One Of The Consuls, To Conduct Himself, A Poor Solitary Old Man, With A Guard Of Soldiers, Into Their Presence.” Still Distrustful, However, And Apprehensive Of An Insurrection, He Ordered His Grandson, Drusus, Whom He Still Kept In Confinement At Rome, To Be Set At Liberty, And If Occasion Required, To Head The Troops. He Had Likewise Ships In Readiness To Transport Him To Any Of The Legions To Which He Might Consider It Expedient To Make His Escape. Meanwhile, He Was Upon The  Watch, From The Summit Of A Lofty Cliff, For The Signals Which He Had Ordered To Be Made If Any Thing Occurred, Lest The Messengers Should Be Tardy. Even When He Had Quite Foiled The Conspiracy Of Sejanus, He Was Still Haunted As Much As Ever With Fears And Apprehensions, Insomuch That He Never Once Stirred Out Of The Villa Jovis For Nine Months After.</a> <span class="flex">490</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="491">Lxvi. To The Extreme Anxiety Of Mind Which He Now Experienced, He Had The Mortification To Find Superadded The Most Poignant Reproaches From All Quarters. Those Who Were Condemned To Die, Heaped Upon Him The Most Opprobrious Language In His Presence, Or By Hand-bills Scattered In The Senators’ Seats In The Theatre. These Produced Different Effects: Sometimes He Wished, Out Of Shame, To Have All Smothered And Concealed; At Other Times He Would Disregard What Was Said, And Publish It Himself. To This Accumulation Of Scandal And Open Sarcasm, There Is To Be Subjoined A Letter From Artabanus, King Of The Parthians, In Which He Upbraids Him With His Parricides, Murders, Cowardice, And Lewdness, And Advises Him To Satisfy The Furious Rage Of His Own People, Which He Had So Justly Excited, By Putting An End To His Life Without Delay.</a> <span class="flex">491</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="492">Lxvii. At Last, Being Quite Weary Of Himself, He Acknowledged His Extreme Misery, In A Letter To The Senate, Which Begun Thus: “What To Write To You, Conscript Fathers, Or How To Write, Or What Not To Write At This Time, May All The Gods And Goddesses Pour Upon My Head A More Terrible Vengeance Than That Under Which I Feel Myself Daily Sinking, If I Can Tell.” Some Are Of Opinion That He Had A Foreknowledge Of Those Things, From His Skill In The Science Of Divination, And Perceived Long Before What Misery And Infamy Would At Last Come Upon Him; And That For This Reason, At The Beginning Of His Reign, He Had Absolutely Refused The Title Of The “Father Of His Country,” And The Proposal Of The Senate To Swear To His Acts; Lest He Should Afterwards, To His Greater Shame, Be Found Unequal To Such Extraordinary Honours. This, Indeed, May Be Justly Inferred From The Speeches Which He Made Upon Both Those Occasions; As When He Says, “I Shall Ever Be The Same, And Shall Never Change My Conduct, So Long As I Retain My Senses; But To Avoid Giving A Bad Precedent To Posterity, The Senate Ought To Beware Of Binding Themselves To The Acts Of  Any Person Whatever, Who Might By Some Accident Or Other Be Induced To Alter Them.” And Again: “If Ye Should At Any Time Entertain A Jealousy Of My Conduct, And My Entire Affection For You, Which Heaven Prevent By Putting A Period To My Days, Rather Than I Should Live To See Such An Alteration In Your Opinion Of Me, The Title Of Father Will Add No Honour To Me, But Be A Reproach To You, For Your Rashness In Conferring It Upon Me, Or Inconstancy In Altering Your Opinion Of Me.”</a> <span class="flex">492</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="493">Lxviii. In Person He Was Large And Robust; Of A Stature Somewhat Above The Common Size; Broad In The Shoulders And Chest, And Proportionable In The Rest Of His Frame. He Used His Left Hand More Readily And With More Force Than His Right; And His Joints Were So Strong, That He Could Bore A Fresh, Sound Apple Through With His Finger, And Wound The Head Of A Boy, Or Even A Young Man, With A Fillip. He Was Of A Fair Complexion, And Wore His Hair So Long Behind, That It Covered His Neck, Which Was Observed To Be A Mark Of Distinction Affected By The Family. He Had A Handsome Face, But It Was Often Full Of Pimples. His Eyes, Which Were Large, Had A Wonderful Faculty Of Seeing In The Night-time, And In The Dark, For A Short Time Only, And Immediately After Awaking From Sleep; But They Soon Grew Dim Again. He Walked With His Neck Stiff And Upright: Generally With A Frowning Countenance, Being For The Most Part Silent: When He Spoke To Those About Him, It Was Very Slowly, And Usually Accompanied With A Slight Gesticulation Of His Fingers. All Which, Being Repulsive Habits And Signs Of Arrogance, Were Remarked By Augustus, Who Often Endeavoured To Excuse Them To The Senate And People, Declaring That “They Were Natural Defects, Which Proceeded From No Viciousness Of Mind.” He Enjoyed A Good State Of Health, Without Interruption, Almost During The Whole Period Of His Rule; Though, From The Thirtieth Year Of His Age, He Treated It Himself According To His Own Discretion, Without Any Medical Assistance.</a> <span class="flex">493</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="494">Lxix. In Regard To The Gods, And Matters Of Religion, He Discovered Much Indifference; Being Greatly Addicted To Astrology, And Fully Persuaded That All Things Were Governed By Fate. Yet He Was Extremely Afraid Of Lightning, And When The Sky Was In A Disturbed State, Always Wore A Laurel Crown On His Head; Because It Is Supposed That The Leaf Of That Tree Is Never Touched By The Lightning.</a> <span class="flex">494</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="497">Lxxi. Though He Was Ready And Conversant With The Greek Tongue, Yet He Did Not Use It Everywhere; But Chiefly He Avoided It In The Senate-house, Insomuch That Having Occasion To Employ The Word Monopolium  Who Was Examined As A Witness Upon A Trial, In Greek , He Would Not Allow To Reply, Except In Latin.</a> <span class="flex">497</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="498">Lxxii. During The Whole Time Of His Seclusion At Capri, Twice Only He Made An Effort To Visit Rome. Once He Came In A Galley As Far As The Gardens Near The Naumachia, But Placed Guards Along The Banks Of The Tiber, To Keep Off All Who Should Offer To Come To Meet Him. The Second Time He Travelled On The Appian Way , As Far As The Seventh Mile-stone From The City, But He Immediately Returned, Without Entering It, Having Only Taken A View Of The Walls At A Distance. For What Reason He Did Not Disembark In His First Excursion, Is Uncertain; But In The Last, He Was Deterred From Entering The City By A Prodigy. He Was In The Habit Of Diverting Himself With A Snake, And Upon Going To Feed It With His Own Hand, According To Custom, He Found It Devoured By Ants: From Which He Was Advised To Beware Of The Fury Of The Mob. On This Account, Returning In All Haste To Campania, He Fell Ill At Astura ; But Recovering A Little, Went On To Circeii . And To Obviate Any Suspicion Of His Being In A Bad State Of Health, He Was Not Only Present At The Sports In The Camp, But Encountered, With Javelins, A Wild Boar, Which Was Let Loose In The Arena. Being Immediately Seized With A Pain In The Side, And Catching Cold Upon His Over-heating Himself In The Exercise, He Relapsed Into A Worse Condition Than He Was Before. He Held Out, However, For Some Time; And Sailing As Far As Misenum , Omitted Nothing  In His Usual Mode Of Life, Not Even In His Entertainments, And Other Gratifications, Partly From An Ungovernable Appetite, And Partly To Conceal His Condition. For Charicles, A Physician, Having Obtained Leave Of Absence, On His Rising From Table, Took His Hand To Kiss It; Upon Which Tiberius, Supposing He Did It To Feel His Pulse, Desired Him To Stay And Resume His Place, And Continued The Entertainment Longer Than Usual. Nor Did He Omit His Usual Custom Of Taking His Station In The Centre Of The Apartment, A Lictor Standing By Him, While He Took Leave Of Each Of The Party By Name.</a> <span class="flex">498</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="499">Lxxiii. Meanwhile, Finding, Upon Looking Over The Acts Of The Senate, “That Some Person Under Prosecution Had Been Discharged, Without Being Brought To A Hearing,” For He Had Only Written Cursorily That They Had Been Denounced By An Informer; He Complained In A Great Rage That He Was Treated With Contempt, And Resolved At All Hazards To Return To Capri; Not Daring To Attempt Any Thing Until He Found Himself In A Place Of Security. But Being Detained By Storms, And The Increasing Violence Of His Disorder, He Died Shortly Afterwards, At A Villa Formerly Belonging To Lucullus, In The Seventy-eighth Year Of His Age , And The Twenty-third Of His Reign, Upon The Seventeenth Of The Calends Of April  And No One Answering The Call, He Rose; But His Strength Failing Him, He Fell Down At A Short Distance From His Bed.”</a> <span class="flex">499</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="500">Lxxiv. Upon His Last Birth-day, He Had Brought A Full-sized Statue Of The Timenian Apollo From Syracuse, A Work Of Exquisite Art, Intending To Place It In The Library Of The New Temple ; But He Dreamt That The God Appeared To Him In The Night, And Assured Him “That His Statue Could Not Be Erected By Him.” A Few Days Before He Died, The Pharos At Capri Was Thrown Down By An Earthquake. And At Misenum, Some Embers And Live Coals, Which Were Brought In To Warm His Apartment, Went Out, And After Being Quite Cold, Burst Out Into A Flame Again Towards Evening, And Continued Burning Very Brightly For Several Hours.</a> <span class="flex">500</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="501">Lxxv. The People Were So Much Elated At His Death, That When They First Heard The News, They Ran Up And Down The City, Some Crying Out, “Away With Tiberius To The Tiber;” Others Exclaiming, “May The Earth, The Common Mother Of Mankind, And The Infernal Gods, Allow Him No Abode In Death, But Amongst The Wicked.” Others Threatened His Body With The Hook And The Gemonian Stairs, Their Indignation At His Former Cruelty Being Increased By A Recent Atrocity. It Had Been Provided By An Act Of The Senate, That The Execution Of Condemned Criminals Should Always Be Deferred Until The Tenth Day After The Sentence. Now This Fell On The Very Day When The News Of Tiberius’s Death Arrived, And In Consequence Of Which The Unhappy Men Implored A Reprieve, For Mercy’s Sake; But, As Caius Had Not Yet Arrived, And There Was No One Else To Whom Application Could Be Made On Their Behalf, Their Guards, Apprehensive Of Violating The Law, Strangled Them, And Threw Them Down The Gemonian Stairs. This Roused The People To A Still Greater Abhorrence Of The Tyrant’s Memory, Since His Cruelty Continued In Use Even After He Was Dead. As Soon As His Corpse Was Begun To Be Moved From Misenum, Many Cried Out For Its Being Carried To Atella , And Being Half Burnt There  In The Amphitheatre. It Was, However, Brought To Rome, And Burnt With The Usual Ceremony.</a> <span class="flex">501</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="502">Lxxvi. He Had Made About Two Years Before, Duplicates Of His Will, One Written By His Own Hand, And The Other By That Of One Of His Freedmen; And Both Were Witnessed By Some Persons Of Very Mean Rank. He Appointed His Two Grandsons, Caius By Germanicus, And Tiberius By Drusus, Joint Heirs To His Estate; And Upon The Death Of One Of Them, The Other Was To Inherit The Whole. He Gave Likewise Many Legacies; Amongst Which Were Bequests To The Vestal Virgins, To All The Soldiers, And Each One Of The People Of Rome, And To The Magistrates Of The Several Quarters Of The City.</a> <span class="flex">502</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="535">Caius Caesar Caligula.</a> <span class="flex">535</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="536">I. Germanicus, The Father Of Caius Caesar, And Son Of Drusus And The Younger Antonia, Was, After His Adoption By Tiberius, His Uncle, Preferred To The Quaestorship  Five Years Before He Had Attained The Legal Age, And Immediately Upon The Expiration Of That Office, To The Consulship . Having Been Sent To The Army In Germany, He Restored Order Among The Legions, Who, Upon The News Of Augustus’s Death, Obstinately Refused To Acknowledge Tiberius As Emperor , And Offered To Place Him At The Head Of The State. In Which Affair It Is Difficult To Say, Whether His Regard To Filial Duty, Or The Firmness Of His Resolution, Was Most Conspicuous. Soon Afterwards He Defeated The Enemy, And Obtained The Honours Of A Triumph. Being Then Made Consul For The Second Time , Before He Could Enter Upon His Office He Was Obliged To Set Out Suddenly For The East, Where, After He Had Conquered The King Of Armenia, And Reduced Cappadocia Into The Form Of A Province, He Died At Antioch, Of A Lingering Distemper, In The Thirty-fourth Year Of His Age , Not Without The Suspicion Of Being Poisoned. For Besides The Livid Spots Which Appeared All Over His Body, And A Foaming At The Mouth; When His Corpse Was Burnt, The Heart Was Found Entire Among The Bones; Its Nature Being Such, As It Is Supposed, That When Tainted By Poison, It Is Indestructible By Fire.</a> <span class="flex">536</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="537">Ii. It Was A Prevailing Opinion, That He Was Taken Off By The Contrivance Of Tiberius, And Through The Means Of Cneius Piso. This Person, Who Was About The Same Time Prefect Of Syria, And Made No Secret Of His Position Being Such, That  He Must Either Offend The Father Or The Son, Loaded Germanicus, Even During His Sickness, With The Most Unbounded And Scurrilous Abuse, Both By Word And Deed; For Which, Upon His Return To Rome, He Narrowly Escaped Being Torn To Pieces By The People, And Was Condemned To Death By The Senate.</a> <span class="flex">537</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="538">Iii. It Is Generally Agreed, That Germanicus Possessed All The Noblest Endowments Of Body And Mind In A Higher Degree Than Had Ever Before Fallen To The Lot Of Any Man; A Handsome Person, Extraordinary Courage, Great Proficiency In Eloquence And Other Branches Of Learning, Both Greek And Roman; Besides A Singular Humanity, And A Behaviour So Engaging, As To Captivate The Affections Of All About Him. The Slenderness Of His Legs Did Not Correspond With The Symmetry And Beauty Of His Person In Other Respects; But This Defect Was At Length Corrected By His Habit Of Riding After Meals. In Battle, He Often Engaged And Slew An Enemy In Single Combat. He Pleaded Causes, Even After He Had The Honour Of A Triumph. Among Other Fruits Of His Studies, He Left Behind Him Some Greek Comedies. Both At Home And Abroad He Always Conducted Himself In A Manner The Most Unassuming. On Entering Any Free And Confederate Town, He Never Would Be Attended By His Lictors. Whenever He Heard, In His Travels, Of The Tombs Of Illustrious Men, He Made Offerings Over Them To The Infernal Deities. He Gave A Common Grave, Under A Mound Of Earth, To The Scattered Relics Of The Legionaries Slain Under Varus, And Was The First To Put His Hand To The Work Of Collecting And Bringing Them To The Place Of Burial. He Was So Extremely Mild And Gentle To His Enemies, Whoever They Were, Or On What Account Soever They Bore Him Enmity, That, Although Piso Rescinded His Decrees, And For A Long Time Severely Harassed His Dependents, He Never Showed The Smallest Resentment, Until He Found Himself Attacked By Magical Charms And Imprecations; And Even Then The Only Steps He Took Was To Renounce All Friendship With Him, According To Ancient Custom, And To Exhort His Servants To Avenge His Death, If Any Thing Untoward Should Befall Him.</a> <span class="flex">538</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="539">Iv. He Reaped The Fruit Of His Noble Qualities In Abundance, Being So Much Esteemed And Beloved By His Friends, That Augustus  Being A Long Time In Doubt, Whether He Should Not Appoint Him His Successor, At Last Ordered Tiberius To Adopt Him. He Was So Extremely Popular, That Many Authors Tell Us, The Crowds Of Those Who Went To Meet Him Upon His Coming To Any Place, Or To Attend Him At His Departure, Were So Prodigious, That He Was Sometimes In Danger Of His Life; And That Upon His Return From Germany, After He Had Quelled The Mutiny In The Army There, All The Cohorts Of The Pretorian Guards Marched Out To Meet Him, Notwithstanding The Order That Only Two Should Go; And That All The People Of Rome, Both Men And Women, Of Every Age, Sex, And Rank, Flocked As Far As The Twentieth Milestone To Attend His Entrance.</a> <span class="flex">539</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="540">V. At The Time Of His Death, However, And Afterwards, They Displayed Still Greater And Stronger Proofs Of Their Extraordinary Attachment To Him. The Day On Which He Died, Stones Were Thrown At The Temples, The Altars Of The Gods Demolished, The Household Gods, In Some Cases, Thrown Into The Streets, And New-born Infants Exposed. It Is Even Said That Barbarous Nations, Both Those Engaged In Intestine Wars, And Those In Hostilities Against Us, All Agreed To A Cessation Of Arms, As If They Had Been Mourning For Some Very Near And Common Friend; That Some Petty Kings Shaved Their Beards And Their Wives’ Heads, In Token Of Their Extreme Sorrow; And That The King Of Kings  Forbore His Exercise Of Hunting And Feasting With His Nobles, Which, Amongst The Parthians, Is Equivalent To A Cessation Of All Business In A Time Of Public Mourning With Us.</a> <span class="flex">540</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="541">Vi. At Rome, Upon The First News Of His Sickness, The City Was Thrown Into Great Consternation And Grief, Waiting Impatiently For Farther Intelligence; When Suddenly, In The Evening, A Report, Without Any Certain Author, Was Spread, That He Was Recovered; Upon Which The People Flocked With Torches  And Victims To The Capitol, And Were In Such Haste To Pay The Vows They Had Made For His Recovery, That They Almost Broke Open The Doors. Tiberius Was Roused From Out Of His Sleep With The Noise Of The People Congratulating One Another, And Singing About The Streets,</a> <span class="flex">541</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="543">Vii. Germanicus Married Agrippina, The Daughter Of Marcus Agrippa And Julia, By Whom He Had Nine Children, Two Of Whom Died In Their Infancy, And Another A Few Years After; A Sprightly Boy, Whose Effigy, In The Character Of A Cupid, Livia Set Up In The Temple Of Venus In The Capitol. Augustus Also Placed Another Statue Of Him In His Bed-chamber, And Used To Kiss It As Often As He Entered The Apartment. The Rest Survived Their Father; Three Daughters, Agrippina, Drusilla, And Livilla, Who Were Born In Three Successive Years; And As Many Sons, Nero, Drusus, And Caius Caesar. Nero And Drusus, At The Accusation Of Tiberius, Were Declared Public Enemies.</a> <span class="flex">543</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="544">Viii. Caius Caesar Was Born On The Day Before The Calends [31St August] Of September, At The Time His Father And Caius Fonteius Capito Were Consuls . But Where He Was Born, Is Rendered Uncertain From The Number Of Places Which Are Said To Have Given Him Birth. Cneius Lentulus Gaetulicus  Says That He Was Born At Tibur; Pliny The Younger, In The Country Of The Treviri, At A Village Called Ambiatinus, Above Confluentes ; And He Alleges, As A Proof Of It, That Altars Are There Shown With This Inscription: “For Agrippina’s Child-birth.” Some Verses Which Were Published In His Reign, Intimate That He Was Born In The Winter Quarters Of The Legions,</a> <span class="flex">544</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="548">Ix. It Was To The Jokes Of The Soldiers In The Camp That He Owed The Name Of Caligula , He Having Been Brought Up Among Them In The Dress Of A Common Soldier. How Much His Education Amongst Them Recommended Him To Their Favour And Affection, Was Sufficiently Apparent In The Mutiny Upon The Death Of Augustus, When The Mere Sight Of Him Appeased Their Fury, Though It Had Risen To A Great Height. For They Persisted In It, Until They Observed That He Was Sent Away To A Neighbouring City , To Secure Him Against All Danger. Then, At Last, They Began To Relent, And, Stopping The Chariot In Which He Was Conveyed, Earnestly Deprecated The Odium To Which Such A Proceeding Would Expose Them.</a> <span class="flex">548</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="549">X. He Likewise Attended His Father In His Expedition To Syria. After His Return, He Lived First With His Mother, And, When She Was Banished, With His Great-grandmother, Livia Augusta, In Praise Of Whom, After Her Decease, Though Then Only A Boy, He Pronounced A Funeral Oration In The Rostra. He Was Then Transferred To The Family Of His Grandmother, Antonia, And Afterwards, In The Twentieth Year Of His Age, Being Called By Tiberius To Capri, He In One And The Same Day Assumed The Manly Habit, And Shaved His Beard, But Without Receiving Any Of The Honours Which Had Been Paid To His Brothers On A Similar  Occasion. While He Remained In That Island, Many Insidious Artifices Were Practised, To Extort From Him Complaints Against Tiberius, But By His Circumspection He Avoided Falling Into The Snare . He Affected To Take No More Notice Of The Ill-treatment Of His Relations, Than If Nothing Had Befallen Them. With Regard To His Own Sufferings, He Seemed Utterly Insensible Of Them, And Behaved With Such Obsequiousness To His Grandfather  And All About Him, That It Was Justly Said Of Him, “There Never Was A Better Servant, Nor A Worse Master.”</a> <span class="flex">549</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="550">Xi. But He Could Not Even Then Conceal His Natural Disposition To Cruelty And Lewdness. He Delighted In Witnessing The Infliction Of Punishments, And Frequented Taverns And Bawdy-houses In The Night-time, Disguised In A Periwig And A Long Coat; And Was Passionately Addicted To The Theatrical Arts Of Singing And Dancing. All These Levities Tiberius Readily Connived At, In Hopes That They Might Perhaps Correct The Roughness Of His Temper, Which The Sagacious Old Man So Well Understood, That He Often Said, “That Caius Was Destined To Be The Ruin Of Himself And All Mankind; And That He Was Rearing A Hydra  For The People Of Rome, And A Phaeton For All The World.”</a> <span class="flex">550</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="551">Xii. Not Long Afterwards, He Married Junia Claudilla, The Daughter Of Marcus Silanus, A Man Of The Highest Rank. Being Then Chosen Augur In The Room Of His Brother Drusus, Before He Could Be Inaugurated He Was Advanced To The Pontificate, With No Small Commendation Of His Dutiful Behaviour, And Great Capacity. The Situation Of The Court Likewise Was At This Time Favourable To His Fortunes, As It Was Now Left Destitute Of Support, Sejanus Being Suspected, And Soon Afterwards Taken Off; And He Was By Degrees Flattered With The Hope Of Succeeding Tiberius In The Empire. In Order More Effectually To Secure This Object, Upon Junia’s Dying In Child-bed, He Engaged In A Criminal Commerce With Ennia Naevia, The Wife  Of Macro, At That Time Prefect Of The Pretorian Cohorts; Promising To Marry Her If He Became Emperor, To Which He Bound Himself, Not Only By An Oath, But By A Written Obligation Under His Hand. Having By Her Means Insinuated Himself Into Macro’s Favour, Some Are Of Opinion That He Attempted To Poison Tiberius, And Ordered His Ring To Be Taken From Him, Before The Breath Was Out Of His Body; And That, Because He Seemed To Hold It Fast, He Caused A Pillow To Be Thrown Upon Him , Squeezing Him By The Throat, At The Same Time, With His Own Hand. One Of His Freedmen Crying Out At This Horrid Barbarity, He Was Immediately Crucified. These Circumstances Are Far From Being Improbable, As Some Authors Relate That, Afterwards, Though He Did Not Acknowledge His Having A Hand In The Death Of Tiberius, Yet He Frankly Declared That He Had Formerly Entertained Such A Design; And As A Proof Of His Affection For His Relations, He Would Frequently Boast, “That, To Revenge The Death Of His Mother And Brothers, He Had Entered The Chamber Of Tiberius, When He Was Asleep, With A Poniard, But Being Seized With A Fit Of Compassion, Threw It Away, And Retired; And That Tiberius, Though Aware Of His Intention, Durst Not Make Any Inquiries, Or Attempt Revenge.”</a> <span class="flex">551</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="552">Xiii. Having Thus Secured The Imperial Power, He Fulfilled By His Elevation The Wish Of The Roman People, I May Venture To Say, Of All Mankind; For He Had Long Been The Object Of Expectation And Desire To The Greater Part Of The Provincials And Soldiers, Who Had Known Him When A Child; And To The Whole People Of Rome, From Their Affection For The Memory Of Germanicus, His Father, And Compassion For The Family Almost Entirely Destroyed. Upon His Moving From Misenum, Therefore, Although He Was In Mourning, And Following The Corpse Of Tiberius, He Had To Walk Amidst Altars, Victims, And Lighted Torches, With Prodigious Crowds Of People Everywhere Attending Him, In Transports Of Joy, And Calling Him, Besides Other Auspicious Names, By Those Of “Their Star,” “Their Chick,” “Their Pretty Puppet,” And “Bantling.”</a> <span class="flex">552</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="553">Xiv. Immediately On His Entering The City, By The Joint Acclamations Of The Senate, And People, Who Broke Into The Senate-house, Tiberius’s Will Was Set Aside, It Having Left His  Other Grandson , Then A Minor, Coheir With Him, The Whole Government And Administration Of Affairs Was Placed In His Hands; So Much To The Joy And Satisfaction Of The Public, That, In Less Than Three Months After, Above A Hundred And Sixty Thousand Victims Are Said To Have Been Offered In Sacrifice. Upon His Going, A Few Days Afterwards, To The Nearest Islands On The Coast Of Campania , Vows Were Made For His Safe Return; Every Person Emulously Testifying Their Care And Concern For His Safety. And When He Fell Ill, The People Hung About The Palatium All Night Long; Some Vowed, In Public Handbills, To Risk Their Lives In The Combats Of The Amphitheatre, And Others To Lay Them Down, For His Recovery. To This Extraordinary Love Entertained For Him By His Countrymen, Was Added An Uncommon Regard By Foreign Nations. Even Artabanus, King Of The Parthians, Who Had Always Manifested Hatred And Contempt For Tiberius, Solicited His Friendship; Came To Hold A Conference With His Consular Lieutenant, And Passing The Euphrates, Paid The Highest Honours To The Eagles, The Roman Standards, And The Images Of The Caesars.</a> <span class="flex">553</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="554">Xv. Caligula Himself Inflamed This Devotion, By Practising All The Arts Of Popularity. After He Had Delivered, With Floods Of Tears, A Speech In Praise Of Tiberius, And Buried Him With The Utmost Pomp, He Immediately Hastened Over To Pandataria And The Pontian Islands , To Bring Thence The Ashes Of His Mother And Brother; And, To Testify The Great Regard He Had For Their Memory, He Performed The Voyage In A Very Tempestuous Season. He Approached Their Remains With Profound Veneration, And Deposited Them In The Urns With His Own Hands. Having Brought Them In Grand Solemnity To Ostia , With An Ensign Flying In The Stern Of The Galley, And Thence Up The Tiber To Rome, They Were Borne By Persons Of The First Distinction In The Equestrian Order, On Two Biers, Into The Mausoleum ,  At Noon-day. He Appointed Yearly Offerings To Be Solemnly And Publicly Celebrated To Their Memory, Besides Circensian Games To That Of His Mother, And A Chariot With Her Image To Be Included In The Procession . The Month Of September He Called Germanicus, In Honour Of His Father. By A Single Decree Of The Senate, He Heaped Upon His Grandmother, Antonia, All The Honours Which Had Been Ever Conferred On The Empress Livia. His Uncle, Claudius, Who Till Then Continued In The Equestrian Order, He Took For His Colleague In The Consulship. He Adopted His Brother, Tiberius , On The Day He Took Upon Him The Manly Habit, And Conferred Upon Him The Title Of “Prince Of The Youths.” As For His Sisters, He Ordered These Words To Be Added To The Oaths Of Allegiance To Himself: “Nor Will I Hold Myself Or My Own Children More Dear Than I Do Caius And His Sisters:”  And Commanded All Resolutions Proposed By The Consuls In The Senate To Be Prefaced Thus: “May What We Are Going To Do, Prove Fortunate And Happy To Caius Caesar And His Sisters.” With The Like Popularity He Restored All Those Who Had Been Condemned And Banished, And Granted An Act Of Indemnity Against All Impeachments And Past Offences. To Relieve The Informers And Witnesses Against His Mother And Brothers From All Apprehension, He Brought The Records Of Their Trials Into The Forum, And There Burnt Them, Calling Loudly On The Gods To Witness That He Had Not Read Or Handled Them. A Memorial Which Was Offered Him Relative To His Own Security, He Would Not Receive, Declaring, “That He Had Done Nothing To Make Any One His Enemy:” And Said, At The Same Time, “He Had No Ears For Informers.”</a> <span class="flex">554</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="555">Xvi. The Spintriae, Those Panderers To Unnatural Lusts , He Banished From The City, Being Prevailed Upon Not To Throw Them  Songs. It Was Likewise Ordained, That The Day On Which He Succeeded To The Empire Should Be Called Palilia, In Token Of The City’s Being At That Time, As It Were, New Founded.</a> <span class="flex">555</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="556">Xvii. He Held The Consulship Four Times; The First , From The Calends [The First] Of July For Two Months: The Second , From The Calends Of January For Thirty Days; The Third , Until The Ides [The 13Th] Of January; And The Fourth  , Until The Seventh Of The Same Ides [7Th January]. Of These, The Two Last He Held Successively. The Third He Assumed By His Sole Authority At Lyons; Not, As Some Are Of Opinion, From Arrogance Or Neglect Of Rules; But Because, At That Distance, It Was Impossible For Him To Know That His Colleague Had Died A Little Before The Beginning Of The New Year. He Twice Distributed To The People A Bounty Of Three Hundred Sesterces A Man, And As Often Gave A Splendid Feast To The Senate And The Equestrian Order, With Their Wives And Children. In The Latter, He Presented To The Men Forensic Garments, And To The Women And Children Purple Scarfs. To Make A Perpetual Addition To The Public Joy For Ever, He Added To The Saturnalia  One Day, Which He Called Juvenalis [The Juvenile Feast].</a> <span class="flex">556</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="557">Xviii. He Exhibited Some Combats Of Gladiators, Either In The Amphitheatre Of Taurus , Or In The Septa, With Which He Intermingled Troops Of The Best Pugilists From Campania And Africa. He Did Not Always Preside In Person Upon Those Occasions, But Sometimes Gave A Commission To Magistrates Or Friends To Supply His Place. He Frequently Entertained The People With Stage-plays  Of Various Kinds, And In Several Parts Of The City, And Sometimes By Night, When He Caused The Whole City To Be Lighted. He Likewise Gave Various Things To Be Scrambled For Among The People, And Distributed To Every Man A Basket Of Bread With Other Victuals. Upon This Occasion, He Sent His Own Share To A Roman Knight, Who Was Seated Opposite To Him, And Was Enjoying Himself By Eating Heartily. To A Senator, Who Was Doing The Same, He Sent An Appointment Of Praetor-extraordinary. He Likewise Exhibited A Great Number Of Circensian Games From Morning Until Night; Intermixed With The Hunting Of Wild Beasts From Africa, Or The Trojan Exhibition. Some Of These Games Were Celebrated With Peculiar Circumstances; The Circus Being Overspread With Vermilion And Chrysolite; And None Drove In The Chariot Races Who Were Not Of The Senatorian Order. For Some Of These He Suddenly Gave The Signal, When, Upon His Viewing From The Gelotiana  The Preparations In The Circus, He Was Asked To Do So By A Few Persons In The Neighbouring Galleries.</a> <span class="flex">557</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="558">Xix. He Invented Besides A New Kind Of Spectacle, Such As Had Never Been Heard Of Before. For He Made A Bridge, Of About Three Miles And A Half In Length, From Baiae To The Mole Of Puteoli , Collecting Trading Vessels From All Quarters, Mooring Them In Two Rows By Their Anchors, And Spreading Earth Upon Them To Form A Viaduct, After The Fashion Of The Appian Way . This Bridge He Crossed And Recrossed For Two Days Together; The First Day Mounted On A Horse Richly Caparisoned, Wearing On His Head A Crown Of Oak Leaves, Armed With A Battle-axe, A Spanish Buckler And A Sword, And In A Cloak Made Of Cloth Of Gold; The Day Following, In The Habit Of A Charioteer, Standing In A Chariot, Drawn By Two High-bred Horses, Having With Him A Young Boy, Darius By Name, One Of The Parthian Hostages, With A Cohort Of The Pretorian Guards Attending Him, And A  Party Of His Friends In Cars Of Gaulish Make . Most People, I Know, Are Of Opinion, That This Bridge Was Designed By Caius, In Imitation Of Xerxes, Who, To The Astonishment Of The World, Laid A Bridge Over The Hellespont, Which Is Somewhat Narrower Than The Distance Betwixt Baiae And Puteoli. Others, However, Thought That He Did It To Strike Terror In Germany And Britain, Which He Was Upon The Point Of Invading, By The Fame Of Some Prodigious Work. But For Myself, When I Was A Boy, I Heard My Grandfather Say , That The Reason Assigned By Some Courtiers Who Were In Habits Of The Greatest Intimacy With Him, Was This; When Tiberius Was In Some Anxiety About The Nomination Of A Successor, And Rather Inclined To Pitch Upon His Grandson, Thrasyllus The Astrologer Had Assured Him, “That Caius Would No More Be Emperor, Than He Would Ride On Horseback Across The Gulf Of Baiae.”</a> <span class="flex">558</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="559">Xx. He Likewise Exhibited Public Diversions In Sicily, Grecian Games At Syracuse, And Attic Plays At Lyons In Gaul Besides A Contest For Pre-eminence In The Grecian And Roman Eloquence; In Which We Are Told That Such As Were Baffled Bestowed Rewards Upon The Best Performers, And Were Obliged To Compose Speeches In Their Praise: But That Those Who Performed The Worst, Were Forced To Blot Out What They Had Written With A Sponge Or Their Tongue, Unless They Preferred To Be Beaten With A Rod, Or Plunged Over Head And Ears Into The Nearest River.</a> <span class="flex">559</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="560">Xxi. He Completed The Works Which Were Left Unfinished By Tiberius, Namely, The Temple Of Augustus, And The Theatre  Of Pompey . He Began, Likewise, The Aqueduct From The Neighbourhood Of Tibur , And An Amphitheatre Near The Septa ; Of Which Works, One Was Completed By His Successor Claudius, And The Other Remained As He Left It. The Walls Of Syracuse, Which Had Fallen To Decay By Length Of Time, He Repaired, As He Likewise Did The Temples Of The Gods. He Formed Plans For Rebuilding The Palace Of Polycrates At Samos, Finishing The Temple Of The Didymaean Apollo At Miletus, And Building A Town On A Ridge Of The Alps; But, Above All, For Cutting Through The Isthmus In Achaia ; And Even Sent A Centurion Of The First Rank To Measure Out The Work.</a> <span class="flex">560</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="561">Xxii. Thus Far We Have Spoken Of Him As A Prince. What Remains To Be Said Of Him, Bespeaks Him Rather A Monster Than A Man. He Assumed A Variety Of Titles, Such As “Dutiful,” “The  Pious,” “The Child Of The Camp, The Father Of The Armies,” And “The Greatest And Best Caesar.” Upon Hearing Some Kings, Who Came To The City To Pay Him Court, Conversing Together At Supper, About Their Illustrious Descent, He Exclaimed,</a> <span class="flex">561</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="565">Xxiii. He Was Unwilling To Be Thought Or Called The Grandson Of Agrippa, Because Of The Obscurity Of His Birth; And He Was Offended If Any One, Either In Prose Or Verse, Ranked Him Amongst The Caesars. He Said That His Mother Was The Fruit Of An Incestuous Commerce, Maintained By Augustus With His Daughter Julia. And Not Content With This Vile Reflection Upon The Memory Of Augustus, He Forbad His Victories At Actium, And On The Coast Of Sicily, To Be Celebrated, As Usual; Affirming That They Had Been Most Pernicious And Fatal To The Roman People. He Called His Grandmother Livia Augusta “Ulysses In A Woman’s Dress,” And Had The Indecency To Reflect Upon Her In A Letter To The Senate, As Of Mean Birth, And Descended, By The Mother’s Side, From A Grandfather Who Was Only One Of The Municipal Magistrates Of Fondi; Whereas It Is Certain, From The Public Records, That Aufidius Lurco Held High Offices At Rome. His Grandmother Antonia Desiring A Private Conference With Him, He Refused To Grant It, Unless Macro, The Prefect Of The Pretorian Guards, Were Present. Indignities Of This Kind, And Ill Usage, Were The Cause Of Her Death; But Some Think He Also Gave Her Poison. Nor Did He Pay The Smallest Respect To Her Memory After Her Death, But Witnessed The Burning From His Private Apartment. His Brother Tiberius, Who Had No Expectation Of Any Violence, Was Suddenly Dispatched By A Military Tribune Sent By His Order For That Purpose. He Forced Silanus, His Father-in-law, To Kill Himself, By Cutting His Throat With A Razor. The Pretext He Alleged For These Murders Was, That The Latter Had Not Followed Him Upon His Putting To Sea In Stormy Weather, But Stayed Behind With The View Of Seizing The City, If He Should Perish. The Other, He Said, Smelt Of An Antidote, Which He Had Taken To Prevent His Being Poisoned By Him; Whereas Silanus Was Only Afraid Of Being Sea-sick, And The Disagreeableness Of A Voyage; And Tiberius Had Merely Taken A Medicine For An Habitual Cough,  Which Was Continually Growing Worse. As For His Successor Claudius, He Only Saved Him For A Laughing-stock.</a> <span class="flex">565</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="566">Xxiv. He Lived In The Habit Of Incest With All His Sisters; And At Table, When Much Company Was Present, He Placed Each Of Them In Turns Below Him, Whilst His Wife Reclined Above Him. It Is Believed, That He Deflowered One Of Them, Drusilla, Before He Had Assumed The Robe Of Manhood; And Was Even Caught In Her Embraces By His Grandmother Antonia, With Whom They Were Educated Together. When She Was Afterwards Married To Cassius Longinus, A Man Of Consular Rank, He Took Her From Him, And Kept Her Constantly As If She Were His Lawful Wife. In A Fit Of Sickness, He By His Will Appointed Her Heiress Both Of His Estate And The Empire. After Her Death, He Ordered A Public Mourning For Her; During Which It Was Capital For Any Person To Laugh, Use The Bath, Or Sup With His Parents, Wife, Or Children. Being Inconsolable Under His Affliction, He Went Hastily, And In The Night-time, From The City; Going Through Campania To Syracuse, And Then Suddenly Returned Without Shaving His Beard, Or Trimming His Hair. Nor Did He Ever Afterwards, In Matters Of The Greatest Importance, Not Even In The Assemblies Of The People Or Before The Soldiers, Swear Any Otherwise, Than “By The Divinity Of Drusilla.” The Rest Of His Sisters He Did Not Treat With So Much Fondness Or Regard; But Frequently Prostituted Them To His Catamites. He Therefore The More Readily Condemned Them In The Case Of Aemilius Lepidus, As Guilty Of Adultery, And Privy To That Conspiracy Against Him. Nor Did He Only Divulge Their Own Hand-writing Relative To The Affair, Which He Procured By Base And Lewd Means, But Likewise Consecrated To Mars The Avenger Three Swords Which Had Been Prepared To Stab Him, With An Inscription, Setting Forth The Occasion Of Their Consecration.</a> <span class="flex">566</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="567">Xxv. Whether In The Marriage Of His Wives, In Repudiating Them, Or Retaining Them, He Acted With Greater Infamy, It Is Difficult To Say. Being At The Wedding Of Caius Piso With Livia Orestilla, He Ordered The Bride To Be Carried To His Own House, But Within A Few Days Divorced Her, And Two Years After Banished Her; Because It Was Thought, That Upon Her Divorce She Returned To The Embraces Of Her Former Husband.  Some Say, That Being Invited To The Wedding-supper, He Sent A Messenger To Piso, Who Sat Opposite To Him, In These Words: “Do Not Be Too Fond With My Wife,” And That He Immediately Carried Her Off. Next Day He Published A Proclamation, Importing, “That He Had Got A Wife As Romulus And Augustus Had Done.”  Lollia Paulina, Who Was Married To A Man Of Consular Rank In Command Of An Army, He Suddenly Called From The Province Where She Was With Her Husband, Upon Mention Being Made That Her Grandmother Was Formerly Very Beautiful, And Married Her; But He Soon Afterwards Parted With Her, Interdicting Her From Having Ever Afterwards Any Commerce With Man. He Loved With A Most Passionate And Constant Affection Caesonia, Who Was Neither Handsome Nor Young; And Was Besides The Mother Of Three Daughters By Another Man; But A Wanton Of Unbounded Lasciviousness. Her He Would Frequently Exhibit To The Soldiers, Dressed In A Military Cloak, With Shield And Helmet, And Riding By His Side. To His Friends He Even Showed Her Naked. After She Had A Child, He Honoured Her With The Title Of Wife; In One And The Same Day, Declaring Himself Her Husband, And Father Of The Child Of Which She Was Delivered. He Named It Julia Drusilla, And Carrying It Round The Temples Of All The Goddesses, Laid It On The Lap Of Minerva; To Whom He Recommended The Care Of Bringing Up And Instructing Her. He Considered Her As His Own Child For No Better Reason Than Her Savage Temper, Which Was Such Even In Her Infancy, That She Would Attack With Her Nails The Face And Eyes Of The Children At Play With Her.</a> <span class="flex">567</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="568">Xxvi. It Would Be Of Little Importance, As Well As Disgusting, To Add To All This An Account Of The Manner In Which He Treated His Relations And Friends; As Ptolemy, King Juba’s Son, His Cousin  Highest Offices In The Government, He Suffered To Run By His Litter In Their Togas For Several Miles Together, And To Attend Him At Supper, Sometimes At The Head Of His Couch, Sometimes At His Feet, With Napkins. Others Of Them, After He Had Privately Put Them To Death, He Nevertheless Continued To Send For, As If They Were Still Alive, And After A Few Days Pretended That They Had Laid Violent Hands Upon Themselves. The Consuls Having Forgotten To Give Public Notice Of His Birth-day, He Displaced Them; And The Republic Was Three Days Without Any One In That High Office. A Quaestor Who Was Said To Be Concerned In A Conspiracy Against Him, He Scourged Severely, Having First Stripped Off His Clothes, And Spread Them Under The Feet Of The Soldiers Employed In The Work, That They Might Stand The More Firm. The Other Orders Likewise He Treated With The Same Insolence And Violence. Being Disturbed By The Noise Of People Taking Their Places At Midnight In The Circus, As They Were To Have Free Admission, He Drove Them All Away With Clubs. In This Tumult, Above Twenty Roman Knights Were Squeezed To Death, With As Many Matrons, With A Great Crowd Besides. When Stage-plays Were Acted, To Occasion Disputes Between The People And The Knights, He Distributed The Money-tickets Sooner Than Usual, That The Seats Assigned To The Knights Might Be All Occupied By The Mob. In The Spectacles Of Gladiators, Sometimes, When The Sun Was Violently Hot, He Would Order The Curtains, Which Covered The Amphitheatre, To Be Drawn Aside , And Forbad Any Person To Be Let Out; Withdrawing At The Same Time The Usual Apparatus For The Entertainment, And Presenting Wild Beasts Almost Pined To Death, The Most Sorry Gladiators, Decrepit With Age, And Fit Only To Work The Machinery, And Decent House-keepers, Who Were Remarkable For Some Bodily Infirmity. Sometimes Shutting Up The Public Granaries, He Would Oblige The People To Starve For A While.</a> <span class="flex">568</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="569">Xxvii. He Evinced The Savage Barbarity Of His Temper Chiefly By The Following Indications. When Flesh Was Only To Be Had At A High Price For Feeding His Wild Beasts Reserved For The Spectacles, He Ordered That Criminals Should Be Given Them  To Be Devoured; And Upon Inspecting Them In A Row, While He Stood In The Middle Of The Portico, Without Troubling Himself To Examine Their Cases He Ordered Them To Be Dragged Away, From “Bald-pate To Bald-pate.”  Of One Person Who Had Made A Vow For His Recovery To Combat With A Gladiator, He Exacted Its Performance; Nor Would He Allow Him To Desist Until He Came Off Conqueror, And After Many Entreaties. Another, Who Had Vowed To Give His Life For The Same Cause, Having Shrunk From The Sacrifice, He Delivered, Adorned As A Victim, With Garlands And Fillets, To Boys, Who Were To Drive Him Through The Streets, Calling On Him To Fulfil His Vow, Until He Was Thrown Headlong From The Ramparts. After Disfiguring Many Persons Of Honourable Rank, By Branding Them In The Face With Hot Irons, He Condemned Them To The Mines, To Work In Repairing The High-ways, Or To Fight With Wild Beasts; Or Tying Them By The Neck And Heels, In The Manner Of Beasts Carried To Slaughter, Would Shut Them Up In Cages, Or Saw Them Asunder. Nor Were These Severities Merely Inflicted For Crimes Of Great Enormity, But For Making Remarks On His Public Games, Or For Not Having Sworn By The Genius Of The Emperor. He Compelled Parents To Be Present At The Execution Of Their Sons; And To One Who Excused Himself On Account Of Indisposition, He Sent His Own Litter. Another He Invited To His Table Immediately After He Had Witnessed The Spectacle, And Coolly Challenged Him To Jest And Be Merry. He Ordered The Overseer Of The Spectacles And Wild Beasts To Be Scourged In Fetters, During Several Days Successively, In His Own Presence, And Did Not Put Him To Death Until He Was Disgusted With The Stench Of His Putrefied Brain. He Burned Alive, In The Centre Of The Arena Of The Amphitheatre, The Writer Of A Farce, For Some Witty Verse, Which Had A Double Meaning. A Roman Knight, Who Had Been Exposed To The Wild Beasts, Crying Out That He Was Innocent, He Called Him Back, And Having Had His Tongue Cut Out, Remanded Him To The Arena.</a> <span class="flex">569</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="570">Xxviii. Asking A Certain Person, Whom He Recalled After A Long Exile, How He Used To Spend His Time, He Replied, With Flattery, “I Was Always Praying The Gods For What Has Happened, That Tiberius Might Die, And You Be Emperor.” Concluding, Therefore, That Those He Had Himself Banished Also  Prayed For His Death, He Sent Orders Round The Islands  To Have Them All Put To Death. Being Very Desirous To Have A Senator Torn To Pieces, He Employed Some Persons To Call Him A Public Enemy, Fall Upon Him As He Entered The Senate-house, Stab Him With Their Styles, And Deliver Him To The Rest To Tear Asunder. Nor Was He Satisfied, Until He Saw The Limbs And Bowels Of The Man, After They Had Been Dragged Through The Streets, Piled Up In A Heap Before Him.</a> <span class="flex">570</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="571">Xxix. He Aggravated His Barbarous Actions By Language Equally Outrageous. “There Is Nothing In My Nature,” Said He, “That I Commend Or Approve So Much, As My Adiatrepsia .” Upon His Grandmother Antonia’s Giving Him Some Advice, As If It Was A Small Matter To Pay No Regard To It, He Said To Her, “Remember That All Things Are Lawful For Me.” When About To Murder His Brother, Whom He Suspected Of Taking Antidotes Against Poison, He Said, “See Then An Antidote Against Caesar!” And When He Banished His Sisters, He Told Them In A Menacing Tone, That He Had Not Only Islands At Command, But Likewise Swords. One Of Pretorian Rank Having Sent Several Times From Anticyra , Whither He Had Gone For His Health, To Have His Leave Of Absence Prolonged, He Ordered Him To Be Put To Death; Adding These Words “Bleeding Is Necessary For One That Has Taken Hellebore So Long, And Found No Benefit.” It Was His Custom Every Tenth Day To Sign The Lists Of Prisoners Appointed For Execution; And This He Called “Clearing His Accounts.” And Having Condemned Several Gauls And Greeks At One Time, He Exclaimed In Triumph, “I Have Conquered Gallograecia.”</a> <span class="flex">571</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="572">Xxx. He Generally Prolonged The Sufferings Of His Victims By Causing Them To Be Inflicted By Slight And Frequently Repeated Strokes; This Being His Well-known And Constant Order:  “Strike So That He May Feel Himself Die.” Having Punished One Person For Another, By Mistaking His Name, He Said, “He Deserved It Quite As Much.” He Had Frequently In His Mouth These Words Of The Tragedian,</a> <span class="flex">572</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="574">Xxxi. He Used Also To Complain Aloud Of The State Of The Times, Because It Was Not Rendered Remarkable By Any Public  Calamities; For, While The Reign Of Augustus Had Been Made Memorable To Posterity By The Disaster Of Varus , And That Of Tiberius By The Fall Of The Theatre At Fidenae , His Was Likely To Pass Into Oblivion, From An Uninterrupted Series Of Prosperity. And, At Times, He Wished For Some Terrible Slaughter Of His Troops, A Famine, A Pestilence, Conflagrations, Or An Earthquake.</a> <span class="flex">574</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="575">Xxxii. Even In The Midst Of His Diversions, While Gaming Or Feasting, This Savage Ferocity, Both In His Language And Actions, Never Forsook Him. Persons Were Often Put To The Torture In His Presence, Whilst He Was Dining Or Carousing. A Soldier, Who Was An Adept In The Art Of Beheading, Used At Such Times To Take Off The Heads Of Prisoners, Who Were Brought In For That Purpose. At Puteoli, At The Dedication Of The Bridge Which He Planned, As Already Mentioned , He Invited A Number Of People To Come To Him From The Shore, And Then Suddenly, Threw Them Headlong Into The Sea; Thrusting Down With Poles And Oars Those Who, To Save Themselves, Had Got Hold Of The Rudders Of The Ships. At Rome, In A Public Feast, A Slave Having Stolen Some Thin Plates Of Silver With Which The Couches Were Inlaid, He Delivered Him Immediately To An Executioner, With Orders To Cut Off His Hands, And Lead Him Round The Guests, With Them Hanging From His Neck Before His Breast, And A Label, Signifying The Cause Of His Punishment. A Gladiator Who Was Practising With Him, And Voluntarily Threw Himself At His Feet, He Stabbed With A Poniard, And Then Ran About With A Palm Branch In His Hand, After The Manner Of Those Who Are Victorious In The Games. When A Victim Was To Be Offered Upon An Altar, He, Clad In The Habit Of The Popae , And Holding The Axe Aloft For A While, At Last, Instead Of The Animal, Slaughtered An Officer Who Attended To Cut Up The Sacrifice. And At A Sumptuous Entertainment, He Fell Suddenly Into A Violent Fit Of Laughter, And Upon The Consuls, Who Reclined Next To Him, Respectfully Asking Him The Occasion, “Nothing,” Replied He, “But That, Upon A Single Nod Of Mine, You Might Both Have Your Throats Cut.”</a> <span class="flex">575</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="577">Xxxiv. In His Behaviour Towards Men Of Almost All Ages, He Discovered A Degree Of Jealousy And Malignity Equal To That Of His Cruelty And Pride. He So Demolished And Dispersed The Statues Of Several Illustrious Persons, Which Had Been Removed By Augustus, For Want Of Room, From The Court Of The Capitol Into The Campus Martius, That It Was Impossible To Set Them Up Again With Their Inscriptions Entire. And, For The Future, He Forbad Any Statue Whatever To Be Erected Without His Knowledge And Leave. He Had Thoughts Too Of Suppressing Homer’s Poems: “For Why,” Said He, “May Not I Do What Plato Has Done Before Me, Who Excluded Him From His Commonwealth?”  He Was Likewise Very Near Banishing The Writings And The Busts Of Virgil And Livy From All Libraries; Censuring One Of Them As “A Man Of No Genius And Very Little Learning;” And The Other As “A Verbose And Careless Historian.” He Often Talked Of The Lawyers As If He Intended To Abolish Their Profession. “By Hercules!” He Would Say, “I Shall Put It Out Of Their Power To Answer Any Questions In Law, Otherwise Than By Referring To Me!”</a> <span class="flex">577</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="578">Xxxv. He Took From The Noblest Persons In The City The Ancient Marks Of Distinction Used By Their Families; As The Collar From Torquatus ; From Cincinnatus The Curl Of  And Crying Out, “A People Who Are Masters Of The World, Pay Greater Respect To A Gladiator For A Trifle, Than To Princes Admitted Amongst The Gods, Or To My Own Majesty Here Present Amongst Them.”</a> <span class="flex">578</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="579">Xxxvi. He Never Had The Least Regard Either To The Chastity Of His Own Person, Or That Of Others. He Is Said To Have Been Inflamed With An Unnatural Passion For Marcus Lepidus Mnester, An Actor In Pantomimes, And For Certain Hostages; And To Have Engaged With Them In The Practice Of Mutual Pollution. Valerius Catullus, A Young Man Of A Consular Family, Bawled Aloud In Public That He Had Been Exhausted By Him In That Abominable Act. Besides His Incest With His Sisters, And His Notorious Passion For Pyrallis, The Prostitute, There Was Hardly Any Lady Of Distinction With Whom He Did Not Make Free. He Used Commonly To Invite Them With Their Husbands To Supper, And As They Passed By The Couch On Which He Reclined At Table, Examine Them Very Closely, Like Those Who Traffic In Slaves; And If Any One From Modesty Held Down Her Face, He Raised It Up With His Hand. Afterwards, As Often As He Was In The Humour, He Would Quit The Room, Send For Her He Liked Best, And In A Short Time Return With Marks Of Recent Disorder About Them. He Would Then Commend Or Disparage Her In The Presence Of The Company, Recounting The Charms Or Defects Of Her Person And Behaviour In Private. To Some He Sent A Divorce In The Name Of Their Absent Husbands, And Ordered It To Be Registered In The Public Acts.</a> <span class="flex">579</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="580">Xxxvii. In The Devices Of His Profuse Expenditure, He Surpassed All The Prodigals That Ever Lived; Inventing A New Kind Of Bath, With Strange Dishes And Suppers, Washing In Precious Unguents, Both Warm And Cold, Drinking Pearls Of Immense Value Dissolved In Vinegar, And Serving Up For His Guests Loaves And Other Victuals Modelled In Gold; Often Saying, “That A Man Ought Either To Be A Good Economist Or An Emperor.” Besides, He Scattered Money To A Prodigious Amount Among The People, From The Top Of The Julian Basilica , During Several Days Successively. He Built Two Ships With Ten Banks Of Oars, After The Liburnian Fashion, The Poops Of Which Blazed With Jewels, And The Sails Were Of Various Parti-colours. They Were Fitted Up With Ample Baths, Galleries, And Saloons, And Supplied With A Great Variety Of Vines And Other Fruit-trees. In These He Would Sail In The Day-time Along The Coast Of Campania, Feasting  Amidst Dancing And Concerts Of Music. In Building His Palaces And Villas, There Was Nothing He Desired To Effect So Much, In Defiance Of All Reason, As What Was Considered Impossible. Accordingly, Moles Were Formed In The Deep And Adverse Sea , Rocks Of The Hardest Stone Cut Away, Plains Raised To The Height Of Mountains With A Vast Mass Of Earth, And The Tops Of Mountains Levelled By Digging; And All These Were To Be Executed With Incredible Speed, For The Least Remissness Was A Capital Offence. Not To Mention Particulars, He Spent Enormous Sums, And The Whole Treasures Which Had Been Amassed By Tiberius Caesar, Amounting To Two Thousand Seven Hundred Millions Of Sesterces, Within Less Than A Year.</a> <span class="flex">580</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="581">Xxxviii. Having Therefore Quite Exhausted These Funds, And Being In Want Of Money, He Had Recourse To Plundering The People, By Every Mode Of False Accusation, Confiscation, And Taxation, That Could Be Invented. He Declared That No One Had Any Right To The Freedom Of Rome, Although Their Ancestors Had Acquired It For Themselves And Their Posterity, Unless They Were Sons; For That None Beyond That Degree Ought To Be Considered As Posterity. When The Grants Of The Divine Julius And Augustus Were Produced To Him, He Only Said, That He Was Very Sorry They Were Obsolete And Out Of Date. He Also Charged All Those With Making False Returns, Who, After The Taking Of The Census, Had By Any Means Whatever Increased Their Property. He Annulled The Wills Of All Who Had Been Centurions Of The First Rank, As Testimonies Of Their Base Ingratitude, If From The Beginning Of Tiberius’s Reign They Had Not Left Either That Prince Or Himself Their Heir. He Also Set Aside The Wills Of All Others, If Any Person Only Pretended To Say, That They Designed At Their Death To Leave Caesar Their Heir. The Public Becoming Terrified At This Proceeding, He Was Now Appointed Joint-heir With Their Friends, And In The Case Of Parents With Their Children, By Persons Unknown To Him. Those Who Lived Any Considerable Time After Making Such A Will, He Said, Were Only Making Game Of Him; And Accordingly He Sent Many Of Them Poisoned Cakes. He Used To Try Such Causes Himself; Fixing Previously The Sum He Proposed To Raise During The Sitting, And, After He Had Secured It, Quitting The Tribunal. Impatient Of The Least Delay, He Condemned By A Single Sentence Forty  Persons, Against Whom There Were Different Charges; Boasting To Caesonia When She Awoke, “How Much Business He Had Dispatched While She Was Taking Her Mid-day Sleep.” He Exposed To Sale By Auction, The Remains Of The Apparatus Used In The Public Spectacles; And Exacted Such Biddings, And Raised The Prices So High, That Some Of The Purchasers Were Ruined, And Bled Themselves To Death. There Is A Well-known Story Told Of Aponius Saturninus, Who Happening To Fall Asleep As He Sat On A Bench At The Sale, Caius Called Out To The Auctioneer, Not To Overlook The Praetorian Personage Who Nodded To Him So Often; And Accordingly The Salesman Went On, Pretending To Take The Nods For Tokens Of Assent, Until Thirteen Gladiators Were Knocked Down To Him At The Sum Of Nine Millions Of Sesterces , He Being In Total Ignorance Of What Was Doing.</a> <span class="flex">581</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="582">Xxxix. Having Also Sold In Gaul All The Clothes, Furniture, Slaves, And Even Freedmen Belonging To His Sisters, At Prodigious Prices, After Their Condemnation, He Was So Much Delighted With His Gains, That He Sent To Rome For All The Furniture Of The Old Palace ; Pressing For Its Conveyance All The Carriages Let To Hire In The City, With The Horses And Mules Belonging To The Bakers, So That They Often Wanted Bread At Rome; And Many Who Had Suits At Law In Progress, Lost Their Causes, Because They Could Not Make Their Appearance In Due Time According To Their Recognizances. In The Sale Of This Furniture, Every Artifice Of Fraud And Imposition Was Employed. Sometimes He Would Rail At The Bidders For Being Niggardly, And Ask Them “If They Were Not Ashamed To Be Richer Than He Was?” At Another, He Would Affect To Be Sorry That The Property Of Princes Should Be Passing Into The Hands Of Private Persons. He Had Found Out That A Rich Provincial Had Given Two Hundred Thousand Sesterces To His Chamberlains For An Underhand Invitation To His Table, And He Was Much Pleased To Find That Honour Valued At So High A Rate. The Day Following, As The Same Person Was Sitting At The Sale, He Sent Him Some Bauble, For Which He Told Him He Must Pay Two Hundred Thousand Sesterces, And “That He Should Sup With Caesar Upon His Own Invitation.”</a> <span class="flex">582</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="585">Xli. These Taxes Being Imposed, But The Act By Which They Were Levied Never Submitted To Public Inspection, Great Grievances Were Experienced From The Want Of Sufficient Knowledge Of The Law. At Length, On The Urgent Demands Of The Roman People, He Published The Law, But It Was Written In A Very Small Hand, And Posted Up In A Corner, So That No One Could Make A Copy Of It. To Leave No Sort Of Gain Untried, He Opened Brothels In The Palatium, With A Number Of Cells, Furnished Suitably To The Dignity Of The Place; In Which Married Women And Free-born Youths Were Ready For The Reception Of Visitors. He Sent Likewise His Nomenclators About The Forums And Courts, To Invite People Of All Ages, The Old As Well As The Young, To His Brothel, To Come And Satisfy Their Lusts; And He Was Ready To Lend His Customers Money Upon Interest; Clerks Attending To Take Down Their Names In Public, As Persons Who Contributed To The Emperor’s Revenue. Another Method Of Raising Money, Which He Thought Not Below His Notice, Was Gaming; Which, By The Help Of Lying And Perjury, He Turned To Considerable Account. Leaving Once The Management Of His Play To His Partner In The Game, He Stepped Into The Court, And Observing Two Rich Roman Knights Passing By, He Ordered Them Immediately To Be Seized, And Their Estates Confiscated. Then Returning, In Great Glee, He Boasted That He Had Never Made A Better Throw In His Life.</a> <span class="flex">585</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="586">Xlii. After The Birth Of His Daughter, Complaining Of His  Poverty, And The Burdens To Which He Was Subjected, Not Only As An Emperor, But A Father, He Made A General Collection For Her Maintenance And Fortune. He Likewise Gave Public Notice, That He Would Receive New-year’s Gifts On The Calends Of January Following; And Accordingly Stood In The Vestibule Of His House, To Clutch The Presents Which People Of All Ranks Threw Down Before Him By Handfuls And Lapfuls. At Last, Being Seized With An Invincible Desire Of Feeling Money, Taking Off His Slippers, He Repeatedly Walked Over Great Heaps Of Gold Coin Spread Upon The Spacious Floor, And Then Laying Himself Down, Rolled His Whole Body In Gold Over And Over Again.</a> <span class="flex">586</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="587">Xliii. Only Once In His Life Did He Take An Active Part In Military Affairs, And Then Not From Any Set Purpose, But During His Journey To Mevania, To See The Grove And River Of Clitumnus . Being Recommended To Recruit A Body Of Batavians, Who Attended Him, He Resolved Upon An Expedition Into Germany. Immediately He Drew Together Several Legions, And Auxiliary Forces From All Quarters, And Made Every Where New Levies With The Utmost Rigour. Collecting Supplies Of All Kinds, Such As Never Had Been Assembled Upon The Like Occasion, He Set Forward On His March, And Pursued It Sometimes With So Much Haste And Precipitation, That The Pretorian Cohorts Were Obliged, Contrary To Custom, To Pack Their Standards On Horses Or Mules, And So Follow Him. At Other Times, He Would March So Slow And Luxuriously, That He Was Carried In A Litter By Eight Men; Ordering The Roads To Be Swept By The People Of The Neighbouring Towns, And Sprinkled With Water To Lay The Dust.</a> <span class="flex">587</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="588">Xliv. On Arriving At The Camp, In Order To Show Himself An Active General, And Severe Disciplinarian, He Cashiered The Lieutenants Who Came Up Late With The Auxiliary Forces From Different Quarters. In Reviewing The Army, He Deprived Of Their Companies Most Of The Centurions Of The First Rank, Who Had Now Served Their Legal Time In The Wars, And Some Whose Time Would Have Expired In A Few Days; Alleging Against Them Their Age And Infirmity; And Railing At The Covetous Disposition  Of The Rest Of Them, He Reduced The Bounty Due To Those Who Had Served Out Their Time To The Sum Of Six Thousand Sesterces. Though He Only Received The Submission Of Adminius, The Son Of Cunobeline, A British King, Who Being Driven From His Native Country By His Father, Came Over To Him With A Small Body Of Troops , Yet, As If The Whole Island Had Been Surrendered To Him, He Dispatched Magnificent Letters To Rome, Ordering The Bearers To Proceed In Their Carriages Directly Up To The Forum And The Senate-house, And Not To Deliver The Letters But To The Consuls In The Temple Of Mars, And In The Presence Of A Full Assembly Of The Senators.</a> <span class="flex">588</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="589">Xlv. Soon After This, There Being No Hostilities, He Ordered A Few Germans Of His Guard To Be Carried Over And Placed In Concealment On The Other Side Of The Rhine, And Word To Be Brought Him After Dinner, That An Enemy Was Advancing With Great Impetuosity. This Being Accordingly Done, He Immediately Threw Himself, With His Friends, And A Party Of The Pretorian Knights, Into The Adjoining Wood, Where Lopping Branches From The Trees, And Forming Trophies Of Them, He Returned By Torch-light, Upbraiding Those Who Did Not Follow Him, With Timorousness And Cowardice; But He Presented The Companions, And Sharers Of His Victory With Crowns Of A New Form, And Under A New Name, Having The Sun, Moon, And Stars Represented On Them, And Which He Called Exploratoriae. Again, Some Hostages Were By His Order Taken From The School, And Privately Sent Off; Upon Notice Of Which He Immediately Rose From Table, Pursued Them With The Cavalry, As If They Had Run Away, And Coming Up With Them, Brought Them Back In Fetters; Proceeding To An Extravagant Pitch Of Ostentation Likewise In This Military Comedy. Upon His Again Sitting Down To Table, It Being Reported To Him That The Troops Were All Reassembled, He Ordered Them To Sit Down As They Were, In Their Armour, Animating Them In The Words Of That Well-known Verse Of Virgil:</a> <span class="flex">589</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="591">Xlvi. At Last, As If Resolved To Make War In Earnest, He Drew Up His Army Upon The Shore Of The Ocean, With His Balistae And Other Engines Of War, And While No One Could Imagine What He Intended To Do, On A Sudden Commanded Them To Gather Up The Sea Shells, And Fill Their Helmets, And The Folds Of Their Dress With Them, Calling Them “The Spoils Of The Ocean Due To The Capitol And The Palatium.” As A Monument Of His Success, He Raised A Lofty Tower, Upon Which, As At Pharos , He Ordered Lights To Be Burnt In The Night-time, For The Direction Of Ships At Sea; And Then Promising The Soldiers A Donative Of A Hundred Denarii  A Man, As If He Had Surpassed The Most Eminent Examples Of Generosity, “Go Your Ways,” Said He, “And Be Merry: Go, Ye Are Rich.”</a> <span class="flex">591</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="592">Xlvii. In Making Preparations For His Triumph, Besides The Prisoners And Deserters From The Barbarian Armies, He Picked Out The Men Of Greatest Stature In All Gaul, Such As He Said Were Fittest To Grace A Triumph, With Some Of The Chiefs, And Reserved Them To Appear In The Procession; Obliging Them Not Only To Dye Their Hair Yellow, And Let It Grow Long, But To Learn The German Language, And Assume The Names Commonly Used In That Country. He Ordered Likewise The Gallies In Which He Had Entered The Ocean, To Be Conveyed To Rome A Great Part Of The Way By Land, And Wrote To His Comptrollers In The City, “To Make Proper Preparations For A Triumph Against  His Arrival, At As Small Expense As Possible; But On A Scale Such As Had Never Been Seen Before, Since They Had Full Power Over The Property Of Every One.”</a> <span class="flex">592</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="593">Xlviii. Before He Left The Province, He Formed A Design Of The Most Horrid Cruelty—to Massacre The Legions Which Had Mutinied Upon The Death Of Augustus, For Seizing And Detaining By Force His Father, Germanicus, Their Commander, And Himself, Then An Infant, In The Camp. Though He Was With Great Difficulty Dissuaded From This Rash Attempt, Yet Neither The Most Urgent Entreaties Nor Representations Could Prevent Him From Persisting In The Design Of Decimating These Legions. Accordingly, He Ordered Them To Assemble Unarmed, Without So Much As Their Swords; And Then Surrounded Them With Armed Horse. But Finding That Many Of Them, Suspecting That Violence Was Intended, Were Making Off, To Arm In Their Own Defence, He Quitted The Assembly As Fast As He Could, And Immediately Marched For Rome; Bending Now All His Fury Against The Senate, Whom He Publicly Threatened, To Divert The General Attention From The Clamour Excited By His Disgraceful Conduct. Amongst Other Pretexts Of Offence, He Complained That He Was Defrauded Of A Triumph, Which Was Justly His Due, Though He Had Just Before Forbidden, Upon Pain Of Death, Any Honour To Be Decreed Him.</a> <span class="flex">593</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="594">Xlix. In His March He Was Waited Upon By Deputies From The Senatorian Order, Entreating Him To Hasten His Return. He Replied To Them, “I Will Come, I Will Come, And This With Me,” Striking At The Same Time The Hilt Of His Sword. He Issued Likewise This Proclamation: “I Am Coming, But For Those Only Who Wish For Me, The Equestrian Order And The People; For I Shall No Longer Treat The Senate As Their Fellow-citizen Or Prince.” He Forbad Any Of The Senators To Come To Meet Him; And Either Abandoning Or Deferring His Triumph, He Entered The City In Ovation On His Birthday. Within Four Months From This Period He Was Slain, After He Had Perpetrated Enormous Crimes, And While He Was Meditating The Execution, If Possible, Of Still Greater. He Had Entertained A Design Of Removing To Antium, And Afterwards To Alexandria; Having First Cut Off The Flower Of The Equestrian And Senatorian Orders. This Is Placed Beyond All Question, By Two Books Which Were Found In His Cabinet  Under Different Titles; One Being Called The Sword, And The Other, The Dagger. They Both Contained Private Marks, And The Names Of Those Who Were Devoted To Death. There Was Also Found A Large Chest, Filled With A Variety Of Poisons Which Being Afterwards Thrown Into The Sea By Order Of Claudius, Are Said To Have So Infected The Waters, That The Fish Were Poisoned, And Cast Dead By The Tide Upon The Neighbouring Shores.</a> <span class="flex">594</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="595">L. He Was Tall, Of A Pale Complexion, Ill-shaped, His Neck And Legs Very Slender, His Eyes And Temples Hollow, His Brows Broad And Knit, His Hair Thin, And The Crown Of The Head Bald. The Other Parts Of His Body Were Much Covered With Hair. On This Account, It Was Reckoned A Capital Crime For Any Person To Look Down From Above, As He Was Passing By, Or So Much As To Name A Goat. His Countenance, Which Was Naturally Hideous And Frightful, He Purposely Rendered More So, Forming It Before A Mirror Into The Most Horrible Contortions. He Was Crazy Both In Body And Mind, Being Subject, When A Boy, To The Falling Sickness. When He Arrived At The Age Of Manhood, He Endured Fatigue Tolerably Well; But Still, Occasionally, He Was Liable To A Faintness, During Which He Remained Incapable Of Any Effort. He Was Not Insensible Of The Disorder Of His Mind, And Sometimes Had Thoughts Of Retiring To Clear His Brain . It Is Believed That His Wife Caesonia Administered To Him A Love Potion Which Threw Him Into A Frenzy. What Most Of All Disordered Him, Was Want Of Sleep, For He Seldom Had More Than Three Or Four Hours’ Rest In A Night; And Even Then His Sleep Was Not Sound, But Disturbed By Strange Dreams; Fancying, Among Other Things, That A Form Representing The Ocean Spoke To Him. Being Therefore Often Weary With Lying Awake So Long, Sometimes He Sat Up In His Bed, At Others, Walked In The Longest Porticos About The House, And From Time To Time, Invoked And Looked Out For The Approach Of Day.</a> <span class="flex">595</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="596">Li. To This Crazy Constitution Of His Mind May, I Think, Very Justly Be Ascribed Two Faults Which He Had, Of A Nature Directly Repugnant One To The Other, Namely, An Excessive Confidence And The Most Abject Timidity. For He, Who Affected So  Much To Despise The Gods, Was Ready To Shut His Eyes, And Wrap Up His Head In His Cloak At The Slightest Storm Of Thunder And Lightning; And If It Was Violent, He Got Up And Hid Himself Under His Bed. In His Visit To Sicily, After Ridiculing Many Strange Objects Which That Country Affords, He Ran Away Suddenly In The Night From Messini, Terrified By The Smoke And Rumbling At The Summit Of Mount Aetna. And Though In Words He Was Very Valiant Against The Barbarians, Yet Upon Passing A Narrow Defile In Germany In His Light Car, Surrounded By A Strong Body Of His Troops, Some One Happening To Say, “There Would Be No Small Consternation Amongst Us, If An Enemy Were To Appear,” He Immediately Mounted His Horse, And Rode Towards The Bridges In Great Haste; But Finding Them Blocked Up With Camp-followers And Baggage-waggons, He Was In Such A Hurry, That He Caused Himself To Be Carried In Men’s Hands Over The Heads Of The Crowd. Soon Afterwards, Upon Hearing That The Germans Were Again In Rebellion, He Prepared To Quit Rome, And Equipped A Fleet; Comforting Himself With This Consideration, That If The Enemy Should Prove Victorious, And Possess Themselves Of The Heights Of The Alps, As The Cimbri  Had Done, Or Of The City, As The Senones  Formerly Did, He Should Still Have In Reserve The Transmarine Provinces . Hence It Was, I Suppose, That It Occurred To His Assassins, To Invent The Story Intended To Pacify The Troops Who Mutinied At His Death, That He Had Laid Violent Hands Upon Himself, In A Fit Of Terror Occasioned By The News Brought Him Of The Defeat Of His Army.</a> <span class="flex">596</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="597">Lii. In The Fashion Of His Clothes, Shoes, And All The Rest Of His Dress, He Did Not Wear What Was Either National, Or Properly Civic, Or Peculiar To The Male Sex, Or Appropriate To Mere Mortals. He Often Appeared Abroad In A Short Coat Of Stout Cloth, Richly Embroidered And Blazing With Jewels, In A Tunic With Sleeves, And With Bracelets Upon His Arms; Sometimes All In Silks And  Habited Like A Woman; At Other Times In The Crepidae Or Buskins; Sometimes In The Sort Of Shoes Used By The Light-armed Soldiers, Or In The Sock Used By Women, And Commonly With A Golden Beard Fixed To His Chin, Holding In His Hand A Thunderbolt, A Trident, Or A Caduceus, Marks Of Distinction Belonging To The Gods Only. Sometimes, Too, He Appeared In The Habit Of Venus. He Wore Very Commonly The Triumphal Ornaments, Even Before His Expedition, And Sometimes The Breast-plate Of Alexander The Great, Taken Out Of His Coffin.</a> <span class="flex">597</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="598">Liii. With Regard To The Liberal Sciences, He Was Little Conversant In Philology, But Applied Himself With Assiduity To The Study Of Eloquence, Being Indeed In Point Of Enunciation Tolerably Elegant And Ready; And In His Perorations, When He Was Moved To Anger, There Was An Abundant Flow Of Words And Periods. In Speaking, His Action Was Vehement, And His Voice So Strong, That He Was Heard At A Great Distance. When Winding Up An Harangue, He Threatened To Draw “The Sword Of His Lucubration,” Holding A Loose And Smooth Style In Such Contempt, That He Said Seneca, Who Was Then Much Admired, “Wrote Only Detached Essays,” And That “His Language Was Nothing But Sand Without Lime.” He Often Wrote Answers To The Speeches Of Successful Orators; And Employed Himself In Composing Accusations Or Vindications Of Eminent Persons, Who Were Impeached Before The Senate; And Gave His Vote For Or Against The Party Accused, According To His Success In Speaking, Inviting The Equestrian Order, By Proclamation, To Hear Him.</a> <span class="flex">598</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="599">Liv. He Also Zealously Applied Himself To The Practice Of Several Other Arts Of Different Kinds, Such As Fencing, Charioteering, Singing, And Dancing. In The First Of These, He Practised With The Weapons Used In War; And Drove The Chariot In Circuses Built In Several Places. He Was So Extremely Fond Of Singing And Dancing, That He Could Not Refrain In The Theatre From Singing With The Tragedians, And Imitating The Gestures Of The Actors, Either By Way Of Applause Or Correction. A Night Exhibition Which He Had Ordered The Day He Was Slain, Was Thought To Be Intended For No Other Reason, Than To Take The Opportunity Afforded By The Licentiousness Of The Season, To Make His First Appearance Upon The Stage. Sometimes, Also,  He Danced In The Night. Summoning Once To The Palatium, In The Second Watch Of The Night , Three Men Of Consular Rank, Who Feared The Words From The Message, He Placed Them On The Proscenium Of The Stage, And Then Suddenly Came Bursting Out, With A Loud Noise Of Flutes And Castanets , Dressed In A Mantle And Tunic Reaching Down To His Heels. Having Danced Out A Song, He Retired. Yet He Who Had Acquired Such Dexterity In Other Exercises, Never Learnt To Swim.</a> <span class="flex">599</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="600">Lv. Those For Whom He Once Conceived A Regard, He Favoured Even To Madness. He Used To Kiss Mnester, The Pantomimic Actor, Publicly In The Theatre; And If Any Person Made The Least Noise While He Was Dancing, He Would Order Him To Be Dragged From His Seat, And Scourged Him With His Own Hand. A Roman Knight Once Making Some Bustle, He Sent Him, By A Centurion, An Order To Depart Forthwith For Ostia , And Carry A Letter From Him To King Ptolemy In Mauritania. The Letter Was Comprised In These Words: “Do Neither Good Nor Harm To The Bearer.” He Made Some Gladiators Captains Of His German Guards. He Deprived The Gladiators Called Mirmillones Of Some Of Their Arms. One Columbus Coming Off With Victory In A Combat, But Being Slightly Wounded, He Ordered Some Poison To Be Infused In The Wound, Which He Thence Called Columbinum. For Thus It Was Certainly Named With His Own Hand In A List Of Other Poisons. He Was So Extravagantly Fond Of The Party Of Charioteers Whose Colours Were Green , That He Supped And Lodged For Some Time Constantly In The Stable Where Their Horses Were Kept. At A Certain Revel, He Made A Present Of Two Millions Of Sesterces To One Cythicus, A Driver Of A Chariot. The Day Before The Circensian Games, He Used To Send His Soldiers To Enjoin Silence In The  Neighbourhood, That The Repose Of His Horse Incitatus  Might Not Be Disturbed. For This Favourite Animal, Besides A Marble Stable, An Ivory Manger, Purple Housings, And A Jewelled Frontlet, He Appointed A House, With A Retinue Of Slaves, And Fine Furniture, For The Reception Of Such As Were Invited In The Horse’s Name To Sup With Him. It Is Even Said That He Intended To Make Him Consul.</a> <span class="flex">600</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="601">Lvi. In This Frantic And Savage Career, Numbers Had Formed Designs For Cutting Him Off; But One Or Two Conspiracies Being Discovered, And Others Postponed For Want Of Opportunity, At Last Two Men Concerted A Plan Together, And Accomplished Their Purpose; Not Without The Privity Of Some Of The Greatest Favourites Amongst His Freedmen, And The Prefects Of The Pretorian Guards; Because, Having Been Named, Though Falsely, As Concerned In One Conspiracy Against Him, They Perceived That They Were Suspected And Become Objects Of His Hatred. For He Had Immediately Endeavoured To Render Them Obnoxious To The Soldiery, Drawing His Sword, And Declaring, “That He Would Kill Himself If They Thought Him Worthy Of Death;” And Ever After He Was Continually Accusing Them To One Another, And Setting Them All Mutually At Variance. The Conspirators Having Resolved To Fall Upon Him As He Returned At Noon From The Palatine Games, Cassius Chaerea, Tribune Of The Pretorian Guards, Claimed The Part Of Making The Onset. This Chaerea Was Now An Elderly Man, And Had Been Often Reproached By Caius For Effeminacy. When He Came For The Watchword, The Latter Would Give “Priapus,” Or “Venus;” And If On Any Occasion He Returned Thanks, Would Offer Him His Hand To Kiss, Making With His Fingers An Obscene Gesture.</a> <span class="flex">601</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="602">Lvii. His Approaching Fate Was Indicated By Many Prodigies. The Statue Of Jupiter At Olympia, Which He Had Ordered To Be Taken Down And Brought To Rome, Suddenly Burst Out Into Such A Violent Fit Of Laughter, That, The Machines Employed In The Work Giving Way, The Workmen Took To Their Heels. When This Accident Happened, There Came Up A Man Named Cassius, Who Said That He Was Commanded In A Dream To Sacrifice A Bull To Jupiter. The Capitol At Capua Was  Struck With Lightning Upon The Ides Of March [15Th March] As Was Also, At Rome, The Apartment Of The Chief Porter Of The Palatium. Some Construed The Latter Into A Presage That The Master Of The Place Was In Danger From His Own Guards; And The Other They Regarded As A Sign, That An Illustrious Person Would Be Cut Off, As Had Happened Before On That Day. Sylla, The Astrologer, Being, Consulted By Him Respecting His Nativity, Assured Him, “That Death Would Unavoidably And Speedily Befall Him.” The Oracle Of Fortune At Antium Likewise Forewarned Him Of Cassius; On Which Account He Had Given Orders For Putting To Death Cassius Longinus, At That Time Proconsul Of Asia, Not Considering That Chaerea Bore Also That Name. The Day Preceding His Death He Dreamt That He Was Standing In Heaven Near The Throne Of Jupiter, Who Giving Him A Push With The Great Toe Of His Right Foot, He Fell Headlong Upon The Earth. Some Things Which Happened The Very Day Of His Death, And Only A Little Before It, Were Likewise Considered As Ominous Presages Of That Event. Whilst He Was At Sacrifice, He Was Bespattered With The Blood Of A Flamingo. And Mnester, The Pantomimic Actor, Performed In A Play, Which The Tragedian Neoptolemus Had Formerly Acted At The Games In Which Philip, The King Of Macedon, Was Slain. And In The Piece Called Laureolus, In Which The Principal Actor, Running Out In A Hurry, And Falling, Vomited Blood, Several Of The Inferior Actors Vying With Each Other To Give The Best Specimen Of Their Art, Made The Whole Stage Flow With Blood. A Spectacle Had Been Purposed To Be Performed That Night, In Which The Fables Of The Infernal Regions Were To Be Represented By Egyptians And Ethiopians.</a> <span class="flex">602</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="603">Lviii. On The Ninth Of The Calends Of February [24Th January], And About The Seventh Hour Of The Day, After Hesitating Whether He Should Rise To Dinner, As His Stomach Was Disordered By What He Had Eaten The Day Before, At Last, By The Advice Of His Friends, He Came Forth. In The Vaulted Passage Through Which He Had To Pass, Were Some Boys Of Noble Extraction, Who Had Been Brought From Asia To Act Upon The Stage, Waiting For Him In A Private Corridor, And He Stopped To See And Speak To Them; And Had Not The Leader Of The Party Said That He Was Suffering From Cold, He Would Have Gone Back, And Made Them Act Immediately. Respecting What Followed,  Two Different Accounts Are Given. Some Say, That, Whilst He Was Speaking To The Boys, Chaerea Came Behind Him, And Gave Him A Heavy Blow On The Neck With His Sword, First Crying Out, “Take This:” That Then A Tribune, By Name Cornelius Sabinus, Another Of The Conspirators, Ran Him Through The Breast. Others Say, That The Crowd Being Kept At A Distance By Some Centurions Who Were In The Plot, Sabinus Came, According To Custom, For The Word, And That Caius Gave Him “Jupiter,” Upon Which Chaerea Cried Out, “Be It So!” And Then, On His Looking Round, Clove One Of His Jaws With A Blow. As He Lay On The Ground, Crying Out That He Was Still Alive , The Rest Dispatched Him With Thirty Wounds. For The Word Agreed Upon Among Them All Was, “Strike Again.” Some Likewise Ran Their Swords Through His Privy Parts. Upon The First Bustle, The Litter Bearers Came Running In With Their Poles To His Assistance, And, Immediately Afterwards, His German Body Guards, Who Killed Some Of The Assassins, And Also Some Senators Who Had No Concern In The Affair.</a> <span class="flex">603</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="604">Lix. He Lived Twenty-nine Years, And Reigned Three Years, Ten Months, And Eight Days. His Body Was Carried Privately Into The Lamian Gardens , Where It Was Half Burnt Upon A Pile Hastily Raised, And Then Had Some Earth Carelessly Thrown Over It. It Was Afterwards Disinterred By His Sisters, On Their Return From Banishment, Burnt To Ashes, And Buried. Before This Was Done, It Is Well Known That The Keepers Of The Gardens Were Greatly Disturbed By Apparitions; And That Not A Night Passed Without Some Terrible Alarm Or Other In The House Where He Was Slain, Until It Was Destroyed By Fire. His Wife Caesonia Was Killed With Him, Being Stabbed By A Centurion; And His Daughter Had Her Brains Knocked Out Against A Wall.</a> <span class="flex">604</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="605">Lx. Of The Miserable Condition Of Those Times, Any Person  May Easily Form An Estimate From The Following Circumstances. When His Death Was Made Public, It Was Not Immediately Credited. People Entertained A Suspicion That A Report Of His Being Killed Had Been Contrived And Spread By Himself, With The View Of Discovering How They Stood Affected Towards Him. Nor Had The Conspirators Fixed Upon Any One To Succeed Him. The Senators Were So Unanimous In Their Resolution To Assert The Liberty Of Their Country, That The Consuls Assembled Them At First Not In The Usual Place Of Meeting, Because It Was Named After Julius Caesar, But In The Capitol. Some Proposed To Abolish The Memory Of The Caesars, And Level Their Temples With The Ground. It Was Particularly Remarked On This Occasion, That All The Caesars, Who Had The Praenomen Of Caius, Died By The Sword, From The Caius Caesar Who Was Slain In The Times Of Cinna.</a> <span class="flex">605</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="613">I. Livia, Having Married Augustus When She Was Pregnant, Was Within Three Months Afterwards Delivered Of Drusus, The Father Of Claudius Caesar, Who Had At First The Praenomen Of Decimus, But Afterwards That Of Nero; And It Was Suspected That He Was Begotten In Adultery By His Father-in-law. The Following Verse, However, Was Immediately In Every One’s Mouth:</a> <span class="flex">613</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="617">Ii. Claudius Was Born At Lyons, In The Consulship Of Julius Antonius, And Fabius Africanus, Upon The First Of August , The Very Day Upon Which An Altar Was First Dedicated There To Augustus. He Was Named Tiberius Claudius Drusus, But Soon Afterwards,  Upon The Adoption Of His Elder Brother Into The Julian Family, He Assumed The Cognomen Of Germanicus. He Was Left An Infant By His Father, And During Almost The Whole Of His Minority, And For Some Time After He Attained The Age Of Manhood, Was Afflicted With A Variety Of Obstinate Disorders, Insomuch That His Mind And Body Being Greatly Impaired, He Was, Even After His Arrival At Years Of Maturity, Never Thought Sufficiently Qualified For Any Public Or Private Employment. He Was, Therefore, During A Long Time, And Even After The Expiration Of His Minority, Under The Direction Of A Pedagogue, Who, He Complains In A Certain Memoir, “Was A Barbarous Wretch, And Formerly Superintendent Of The Mule-drivers, Who Was Selected For His Governor, On Purpose To Correct Him Severely On Every Trifling Occasion.” On Account Of This Crazy Constitution Of Body And Mind, At The Spectacle Of Gladiators, Which He Gave The People, Jointly With His Brother, In Honour Of His Father’s Memory, He Presided, Muffled Up In A Pallium—a New Fashion. When He Assumed The Manly Habit, He Was Carried In A Litter, At Midnight, To The Capitol, Without The Usual Ceremony.</a> <span class="flex">617</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="618">Iii. He Applied Himself, However, From An Early Age, With Great Assiduity To The Study Of The Liberal Sciences, And Frequently Published Specimens Of His Skill In Each Of Them. But Never, With All His Endeavours, Could He Attain To Any Public Post In The Government, Or Afford Any Hope Of Arriving At Distinction Thereafter. His Mother, Antonia, Frequently Called Him “An Abortion Of A Man, That Had Been Only Begun, But Never Finished, By Nature.” And When She Would Upbraid Any One With Dulness, She Said, “He Was A Greater Fool Than Her Son, Claudius.” His Grandmother, Augusta, Always Treated Him With The Utmost Contempt, Very Rarely Spoke To Him, And When She Did Admonish Him Upon Any Occasion, It Was In Writing, Very Briefly And Severely, Or By Messengers. His Sister, Livilla, Upon Hearing That He Was About To Be Created Emperor, Openly And Loudly Expressed Her Indignation That The Roman People Should Experience A Fate So Severe And So Much Below Their Grandeur. To Exhibit The Opinion, Both Favourable And Otherwise, Entertained Concerning Him By Augustus, His Great-uncle, I Have Here Subjoined Some Extracts From The Letters Of That Emperor.</a> <span class="flex">618</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="619">Iv. “I Have Had Some Conversation With Tiberius, According  Settle This Affair Once For All, That We May Not Be Always In Suspense Between Hope And Fear. You May, If You Think Proper, Give Your Kinsman Antonia This Part Of My Letter To Read.” In Another Letter, He Writes As Follows: “I Shall Invite: The Youth, Tiberius, Every Day During Your Absence, To Supper, That He May Not Sup Alone With His Friends Sulpicius And Athenodorus. I Wish The Poor Creature Was More Cautious And Attentive In The Choice Of Some One, Whose Manners, Air, And Gait Might Be Proper For His Imitation:</a> <span class="flex">619</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="621">V. Upon His Requesting Some Office In The State, Tiberius Granted Him The Honorary Appendages Of The Consulship, And When He Pressed For A Legitimate Appointment, The Emperor Wrote Word Back, That “He Sent Him Forty Gold Pieces For His Expenses, During The Festivals Of The Saturnalia And Sigillaria.” Upon This, Laying Aside All Hope Of Advancement, He Resigned Himself Entirely To An Indolent Life; Living In Great Privacy, One While In His Gardens, Or A Villa Which He Had Near The City; Another While In Campania, Where He Passed His Time In The Lowest Society; By Which Means, Besides His Former Character Of A Dull, Heavy Fellow, He Acquired That Of A Drunkard And Gamester.</a> <span class="flex">621</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="622">Vi. Notwithstanding This Sort Of Life, Much Respect Was Shown Him Both In Public And Private. The Equestrian  Order Twice Made Choice Of Him To Intercede On Their Behalf; Once To Obtain From The Consuls The Favour Of Bearing On Their Shoulders The Corpse Of Augustus To Rome, And A Second Time To Congratulate Him Upon The Death Of Sejanus. When He Entered The Theatre, They Used To Rise, And Put Off Their Cloaks. The Senate Likewise Decreed, That He Should Be Added To The Number Of The Augustal College Of Priests, Who Were Chosen By Lot; And Soon Afterwards, When His House Was Burnt Down, That It Should Be Rebuilt At The Public Charge; And That He Should Have The Privilege Of Giving His Vote Amongst The Men Of Consular Rank. This Decree Was, However, Repealed; Tiberius Insisting To Have Him Excused On Account Of His Imbecility, And Promising To Make Good His Loss At His Own Expense. But At His Death, He Named Him In His Will, Amongst His Third Heirs, For A Third Part Of His Estate; Leaving Him Besides A Legacy Of Two Millions Of Sesterces, And Expressly Recommending Him To The Armies, The Senate And People Of Rome, Amongst His Other Relations.</a> <span class="flex">622</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="623">Vii. At Last, Caius , His Brother’s Son, Upon His Advancement To The Empire, Endeavouring To Gain The Affections Of The Public By All The Arts Of Popularity, Claudius Also Was Admitted To Public Offices, And Held The Consulship Jointly With His Nephew For Two Months. As He Was Entering The Forum For The First Time With The Fasces, An Eagle Which Was Flying That Way; Alighted Upon His Right Shoulder. A Second Consulship Was Also Allotted Him, To Commence At The Expiration Of The Fourth Year. He Sometimes Presided At The Public Spectacles, As The Representative Of Caius; Being Always, On Those Occasions, Complimented With The Acclamations Of The People, Wishing Him All Happiness, Sometimes Under The Title Of The Emperor’s Uncle, And Sometimes Under That Of Germanicus’s Brother.</a> <span class="flex">623</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="624">Viii. Still He Was Subjected To Many Slights. If At Any Time He Came In Late To Supper, He Was Obliged To Walk Round The Room Some Time Before He Could Get A Place At Table. When He Indulged Himself With Sleep After Eating, Which Was A Common Practice With Him, The Company Used To Throw Olive-stones And Dates At Him. And The Buffoons Who Attended Would Wake Him, As If It Were Only In Jest, With A Cane Or A Whip. Sometimes They Would Put Slippers Upon His Hands; As He Lay Snoring, That He Might, Upon Awaking, Rub His Face With Them.</a> <span class="flex">624</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="625">Ix. He Was Not Only Exposed To Contempt, But Sometimes Likewise To Considerable Danger: First, In His Consulship; For, Having Been Too Remiss In Providing And Erecting The Statues Of Caius’s Brothers, Nero And Drusus, He Was Very Near Being Deprived Of His Office; And Afterwards He Was Continually Harassed With Informations Against Him By One Or Other, Sometimes Even By His Own Domestics. When The Conspiracy Of Lepidus And Gaetulicus Was Discovered, Being Sent With Some Other Deputies Into Germany , To Congratulate The Emperor Upon The Occasion, He Was In Danger Of His Life; Caius Being Greatly Enraged, And Loudly Complaining, That His Uncle Was Sent To Him, As If He Was A Boy Who Wanted A Governor. Some Even Say, That He Was Thrown Into A River, In His Travelling Dress. From This Period, He Voted In The Senate Always The Last Of The Members Of Consular Rank; Being Called Upon After The Rest, On Purpose To Disgrace Him. A Charge For The Forgery Of A Will Was Also Allowed To Be Prosecuted, Though He Had Only Signed It As A Witness. At Last, Being Obliged To Pay Eight Millions Of Sesterces On Entering Upon A New Office Of Priesthood, He Was Reduced To Such Straits In His Private Affairs, That In Order To Discharge His Bond To The Treasury, He Was Under The Necessity Of Exposing To Sale His Whole Estate, By An Order Of The Prefects.</a> <span class="flex">625</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="626">X. Having Spent The Greater Part Of His Life Under These And The Like Circumstances, He Came At Last To The Empire In The Fiftieth Year Of His Age , By A Very Surprising Turn Of Fortune. Being, As Well As The Rest, Prevented From Approaching Caius By The Conspirators, Who Dispersed The Crowd, Under The Pretext Of His Desiring To Be Private, He Retired Into An Apartment Called The Hermaeum ; And Soon Afterwards, Terrified By The Report Of Caius Being Slain, He Crept Into An Adjoining Balcony, Where He Hid Himself Behind The Hangings Of  The Door. A Common Soldier, Who Happened To Pass That Way, Spying His Feet, And Desirous To Discover Who He Was, Pulled Him Out; When Immediately Recognizing Him, He Threw Himself In A Great Fright At His Feet, And Saluted Him By The Title Of Emperor. He Then Conducted Him To His Fellow-soldiers, Who Were All In A Great Rage, And Irresolute What They Should Do. They Put Him Into A Litter, And As The Slaves Of The Palace Had All Fled, Took Their Turns In Carrying Him On Their Shoulders, And Brought Him Into The Camp, Sad And Trembling; The People Who Met Him Lamenting His Situation, As If The Poor Innocent Was Being Carried To Execution. Being Received Within The Ramparts , He Continued All Night With The Sentries On Guard, Recovered Somewhat From His Fright, But In No Great Hopes Of The Succession. For The Consuls, With The Senate And Civic Troops, Had Possessed Themselves Of The Forum And Capitol, With The Determination To Assert The Public Liberty; And He Being Sent For Likewise, By A Tribune Of The People, To The Senate-house, To Give His Advice Upon The Present Juncture Of Affairs, Returned Answer, “I Am Under Constraint, And Cannot Possibly Come.” The Day Afterwards, The Senate Being Dilatory In Their Proceedings, And Worn Out By Divisions Amongst Themselves, While The People Who Surrounded The Senate-house Shouted That They Would Have One Master, Naming Claudius, He Suffered The Soldiers Assembled Under Arms To Swear Allegiance To Him, Promising Them Fifteen Thousand Sesterces A Man; He Being The First Of The Caesars Who Purchased The Submission Of The Soldiers With Money.</a> <span class="flex">626</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="627">Xi. Having Thus Established Himself In Power, His First Object Was To Abolish All Remembrance Of The Two Preceding Days, In Which A Revolution In The State Had Been Canvassed. Accordingly, He Passed An Act Of Perpetual Oblivion And Pardon For Every Thing Said Or Done During That Time; And This He Faithfully Observed, With The Exception Only Of Putting To Death A Few Tribunes And Centurions Concerned In The Conspiracy Against Caius, Both As An Example, And Because He Understood That They Had Also Planned His Own Death. He Now Turned  His Thoughts Towards Paying Respect To The Memory Of His Relations. His Most Solemn And Usual Oath Was, “By Augustus.” He Prevailed Upon The Senate To Decree Divine Honours To His Grandmother Livia, With A Chariot In The Circensian Procession Drawn By Elephants, As Had Been Appointed For Augustus ; And Public Offerings To The Shades Of His Parents. Besides Which, He Instituted Circensian Games For His Father, To Be Celebrated Every Year, Upon His Birth-day, And, For His Mother, A Chariot To Be Drawn Through The Circus; With The Title Of Augusta, Which Had Been Refused By His Grandmother . To The Memory Of His Brother , To Which, Upon All Occasions, He Showed A Great Regard, He Gave A Greek Comedy, To Be Exhibited In The Public Diversions At Naples , And Awarded The Crown For It, According To The Sentence Of The Judges In That Solemnity. Nor Did He Omit To Make Honourable And Grateful Mention Of Mark Antony; Declaring By A Proclamation, “That He The More Earnestly Insisted Upon The Observation Of His Father Drusus’s Birth-day, Because It Was Likewise That Of His Grandfather Antony.” He Completed The Marble Arch Near Pompey’s Theatre, Which Had Formerly Been Decreed By The Senate In Honour Of Tiberius, But Which Had Been Neglected . And Though He Cancelled All The Acts Of Caius, Yet He Forbad The Day Of His Assassination, Notwithstanding It Was That Of His Own Accession To The Empire, To Be Reckoned Amongst The Festivals.</a> <span class="flex">627</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="628">Xii. But With Regard To His Own Aggrandisement, He Was Sparing And Modest, Declining The Title Of Emperor, And Refusing All Excessive Honours. He Celebrated The Marriage Of His Daughter And The Birth-day Of A Grandson With Great Privacy, At Home. He Recalled None Of Those Who Had Been Banished, Without A Decree Of The Senate: And Requested Of Them Permission For The Prefect Of The Military Tribunes And Pretorian Guards To Attend Him In The Senate-house ; And  Also That They Would Be Pleased To Bestow Upon His Procurators Judicial Authority In The Provinces . He Asked Of The Consuls Likewise The Privilege Of Holding Fairs Upon His Private Estate. He Frequently Assisted The Magistrates In The Trial Of Causes, As One Of Their Assessors. And When They Gave Public Spectacles, He Would Rise Up With The Rest Of The Spectators, And Salute Them Both By Words And Gestures. When The Tribunes Of The People Came To Him While He Was On The Tribunal, He Excused Himself, Because, On Account Of The Crowd, He Could Not Hear Them Unless They Stood. In A Short Time, By This Conduct, He Wrought Himself So Much Into The Favour And Affection Of The Public, That When, Upon His Going To Ostia, A Report Was Spread In The City That He Had Been Way-laid And Slain, The People Never Ceased Cursing The Soldiers For Traitors, And The Senate As Parricides, Until One Or Two Persons, And Presently After Several Others, Were Brought By The Magistrates Upon The Rostra, Who Assured Them That He Was Alive, And Not Far From The City, On His Way Home.</a> <span class="flex">628</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="629">Xiii. Conspiracies, However, Were Formed Against Him, Not Only By Individuals Separately, But By A Faction; And At Last His Government Was Disturbed With A Civil War. A Low Fellow Was Found With A Poniard About Him, Near His Chamber, At Midnight. Two Men Of The Equestrian Order Were Discovered Waiting For Him In The Streets, Armed With A Tuck And A Huntsman’s Dagger; One Of Them Intending To Attack Him As He Came Out Of The Theatre, And The Other As He Was Sacrificing In The Temple Of Mars. Gallus Asinius And Statilius Corvinus, Grandsons Of The Two Orators, Pollio And Messala , Formed A Conspiracy Against Him, In Which They Engaged Many Of His Freedmen And Slaves. Furius Camillus Scribonianus, His Lieutenant In Dalmatia, Broke Into Rebellion, But Was Reduced In  The Space Of Five Days; The Legions Which He Had Seduced From Their Oath Of Fidelity Relinquishing Their Purpose, Upon An Alarm Occasioned By Ill Omens. For When Orders Were Given Them To March, To Meet Their New Emperor, The Eagles Could Not Be Decorated, Nor The Standards Pulled Out Of The Ground, Whether It Was By Accident, Or A Divine Interposition.</a> <span class="flex">629</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="630">Xiv. Besides His Former Consulship, He Held The Office Afterwards Four Times; The First Two Successively , But The Following, After An Interval Of Four Years Each ; The Last For Six Months, The Others For Two; And The Third, Upon His Being Chosen In The Room Of A Consul Who Died; Which Had Never Been Done By Any Of The Emperors Before Him. Whether He Was Consul Or Out Of Office, He Constantly Attended The Courts For The Administration Of Justice, Even Upon Such Days As Were Solemnly Observed As Days Of Rejoicing In His Family, Or By His Friends; And Sometimes Upon The Public Festivals Of Ancient Institution. Nor Did He Always Adhere Strictly To The Letter Of The Laws, But Overruled The Rigour Or Lenity Of Many Of Their Enactments, According To His Sentiments Of Justice And Equity. For Where Persons Lost Their Suits By Insisting Upon More Than Appeared To Be Their Due, Before The Judges Of Private Causes, He Granted Them The Indulgence Of A Second Trial. And With Regard To Such As Were Convicted Of Any Great Delinquency, He Even Exceeded The Punishment Appointed By Law, And Condemned Them To Be Exposed To Wild Beasts.</a> <span class="flex">630</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="631">Xv. But In Hearing And Determining Causes, He Exhibited A Strange Inconsistency Of Temper, Being At One Time Circumspect And Sagacious, At Another Inconsiderate And Rash, And Sometimes Frivolous, And Like One Out Of His Mind. In Correcting The Roll Of Judges, He Struck Off The Name Of One Who, Concealing The Privilege His Children Gave Him To Be Excused From Serving, Had Answered To His Name, As Too Eager For The Office. Another Who Was Summoned Before Him In A Cause Of His Own, But Alleged That The Affair Did Not Properly Come Under The  Call Him Back, As He Was Quitting The Tribunal, But Would Seize Him By The Lap Of His Coat, And Sometimes Catch Him By The Heels, To Make Him Stay. That Such Behaviour, However Strange, Is Not Incredible, Will Appear From This Anecdote. Some Obscure Greek, Who Was A Litigant, Had An Altercation With Him, In Which He Called Out, “You Are An Old Fool.”  It Is Certain That A Roman Knight, Who Was Prosecuted By An Impotent Device Of His Enemies On A False Charge Of Abominable Obscenity With Women, Observing That Common Strumpets Were Summoned Against Him And Allowed To Give Evidence, Upbraided Claudius In Very Harsh And Severe Terms With His Folly And Cruelty, And Threw His Style, And Some Books Which He Had In His Hands, In His Face, With Such Violence As To Wound Him Severely In The Cheek.</a> <span class="flex">631</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="632">Xvi. He Likewise Assumed The Censorship , Which Had Been Discontinued Since The Time That Paulus And Plancus Had Jointly Held It. But This Also He Administered Very Unequally, And With A Strange Variety Of Humour And Conduct. In His Review Of The Knights, He Passed Over, Without Any Mark Of Disgrace, A Profligate Young Man, Only Because His Father Spoke Of Him In The Highest Terms; “For,” Said He, “His Father Is His Proper Censor.” Another, Who Was Infamous For Debauching Youths And For Adultery, He Only Admonished “To Indulge His Youthful Inclinations More Sparingly, Or At Least More Cautiously;”  Adding, “Why Must I Know What Mistress You Keep?” When, At The Request Of His Friends, He Had Taken Off A Mark Of Infamy Which He Had Set Upon One Knight’s Name, He Said, “Let The Blot, However, Remain.” He Not Only Struck Out Of The List Of Judges, But Likewise Deprived Of The Freedom Of Rome, An Illustrious Man Of The Highest Provincial Rank In Greece, Only Because He Was Ignorant Of The Latin Language. Nor In This Review Did He Suffer Any One To Give An Account Of His Conduct By An Advocate, But Obliged Each Man To Speak For Himself In The Best Way He Could. He Disgraced Many, And Some That Little Expected It, And For A Reason Entirely New, Namely, For Going Out Of Italy Without His License;  And One Likewise, For Having In His Province Been The Familiar Companion Of A King; Observing, That, In Former Times, Rabirius Posthumus Had Been Prosecuted For Treason, Although He Only Went After Ptolemy To Alexandria For The Purpose Of Securing Payment Of A Debt . Having Tried To Brand With Disgrace Several Others, He, To His Own Greater Shame, Found Them Generally Innocent, Through The Negligence Of The Persons Employed To Inquire Into Their Characters; Those Whom He Charged With Living In Celibacy, With Want Of Children, Or Estate, Proving Themselves To Be Husbands, Parents, And In Affluent Circumstances. One Of The Knights Who Was Charged With Stabbing Himself, Laid His Bosom Bare, To Show That There Was Not The Least Mark Of Violence Upon His Body. The Following Incidents Were Remarkable In His Censorship. He Ordered A Car, Plated With Silver, And Of Very Sumptuous Workmanship, Which Was Exposed For Sale In The Sigillaria , To Be Purchased, And Broken In Pieces Before His Eyes. He Published Twenty Proclamations In One Day, In One Of Which He Advised The People, “Since The Vintage Was Very Plentiful, To Have Their Casks Well Secured At The Bung With Pitch:” And In Another, He Told Them, “That Nothing Would Sooner Cure The Bite Of A Viper, Than The Sap Of The Yew-tree.”</a> <span class="flex">632</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="633">Xvii. He Undertook Only One Expedition, And That Was Of Short Duration. The Triumphal Ornaments Decreed Him By The Senate, He Considered As Beneath The Imperial Dignity, And Was Therefore Resolved To Have The Honour Of A Real Triumph. For This Purpose, He Selected Britain, Which Had Never Been Attempted By Any One Since Julius Caesar , And Was Then Chafing  Gave Leave To Governors Of Provinces To Come To Rome, But Even To Some Of The Exiles. Among The Spoils Taken From The Enemy, He Fixed Upon The Pediment Of His House In The Palatium, A Naval Crown, In Token Of His Having Passed, And, As It Were, Conquered The Ocean, And Had It Suspended Near The Civic Crown Which Was There Before. Messalina, His Wife, Followed His Chariot In A Covered Litter . Those Who Had Attained The Honour Of Triumphal Ornaments In The Same War, Rode Behind; The Rest Followed On Foot, Wearing The Robe With The Broad Stripes. Crassus Frugi Was Mounted Upon A Horse Richly Caparisoned, In A Robe Embroidered With Palm Leaves, Because This Was The Second Time Of His Obtaining That Honour.</a> <span class="flex">633</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="634">Xviii. He Paid Particular Attention To The Care Of The City, And To Have It Well Supplied With Provisions. A Dreadful Fire Happening In The Aemiliana , Which Lasted Some Time, He Passed Two Nights In The Diribitorium , And The Soldiers And Gladiators Not Being In Sufficient Numbers To Extinguish It, He Caused The Magistrates To Summon The People Out Of All The Streets In The City, To Their Assistance. Placing Bags Of Money Before Him, He Encouraged Them To Do Their Utmost, Declaring, That He Would Reward Every One On The Spot, According To Their Exertions.</a> <span class="flex">634</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="635">Xix. During A Scarcity Of Provisions, Occasioned By Bad Crops For Several Successive Years, He Was Stopped In The Middle Of The Forum By The Mob, Who So Abused Him, At The Same Time Pelting Him With Fragments Of Bread, That He Had Some  Difficulty In Escaping Into The Palace By A Back Door. He Therefore Used All Possible Means To Bring Provisions To The City, Even In The Winter. He Proposed To The Merchants A Sure Profit, By Indemnifying Them Against Any Loss That Might Befall Them By Storms At Sea; And Granted Great Privileges To Those Who Built Ships For That Traffic. To A Citizen Of Rome He Gave An Exemption From The Penalty Of The Papia-poppaean Law ; To One Who Had Only The Privilege Of Latium, The Freedom Of The City; And To Women The Rights Which By Law Belonged To Those Who Had Four Children: Which Enactments Are In Force To This Day.</a> <span class="flex">635</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="636">Xx. He Completed Some Important Public Works, Which, Though Not Numerous, Were Very Useful. The Principal Were An Aqueduct, Which Had Been Begun By Caius; An Emissary For The Discharge Of The Waters Of The Fucine Lake , And The Harbour Of Ostia; Although He Knew That Augustus Had Refused To Comply With The Repeated Application Of The Marsians For One Of These; And That The Other Had Been Several Times Intended By Julius Caesar, But As Often Abandoned On Account Of The Difficulty Of Its Execution. He Brought To The City The Cool And Plentiful Springs Of The Claudian Water, One Of Which Is Called Caeruleus, And The Other Curtius And Albudinus, As Likewise The River Of The New Anio, In A Stone Canal; And Distributed Them Into Many Magnificent Reservoirs. The Canal From The Fucine Lake Was Undertaken As Much For The Sake Of Profit, As For The Honour Of The Enterprise; For There Were Parties Who Offered To Drain It At Their Own Expense, On Condition Of Their Having A Grant Of The Land Laid Dry. With Great Difficulty He Completed A Canal Three Miles In Length, Partly By Cutting Through, And Partly By Tunnelling, A Mountain; Thirty Thousand Men Being Constantly Employed In The Work For Eleven Years . He Formed The Harbour At Ostia, By Carrying Out Circular Piers On The Right And On The Left, With  A Mole Protecting, In Deep Water, The Entrance Of The Port . To Secure The Foundation Of This Mole, He Sunk The Vessel In Which The Great Obelisk  Had Been Brought From Egypt ; And Built Upon Piles A Very Lofty Tower, In Imitation Of The Pharos At Alexandria, On Which Lights Were Burnt To Direct Mariners In The Night.</a> <span class="flex">636</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="637">Xxi. He Often Distributed Largesses Of Corn And Money Among The People, And Entertained Them With A Great Variety Of Public Magnificent Spectacles, Not Only Such As Were Usual, And In The Accustomed Places, But Some Of New Invention, And Others Revived From Ancient Models, And Exhibited In Places Where Nothing Of The Kind Had Been Ever Before Attempted. In The Games Which He Presented At The Dedication Of Pompey’s Theatre , Which Had Been Burnt Down, And Was Rebuilt By Him, He Presided Upon A Tribunal Erected For Him In The Orchestra; Having First Paid His Devotions, In The Temple Above, And Then Coming Down Through The Centre Of The Circle, While All The People Kept Their Seats In Profound Silence . He Likewise  Joined By The Common People, Count Upon His Fingers Aloud The Gold Pieces Presented To Those Who Came Off Conquerors. He Would Earnestly Invite The Company To Be Merry; Sometimes Calling Them His “Masters,” With A Mixture Of Insipid, Far-fetched Jests. Thus, When The People Called For Palumbus , He Said, “He Would Give Them One When He Could Catch It.” The Following Was Well-intended, And Well-timed; Having, Amidst Great Applause, Spared A Gladiator, On The Intercession Of His Four Sons, He Sent A Billet Immediately Round The Theatre, To Remind The People, “How Much It Behoved Them To Get Children, Since They Had Before Them An Example How Useful They Had Been In Procuring Favour And Security For A Gladiator.” He Likewise Represented In The Campus Martius, The Assault And Sacking Of A Town, And The Surrender Of The British Kings , Presiding In His General’s Cloak. Immediately Before He Drew Off The Waters From The Fucine Lake, He Exhibited Upon It A Naval Fight. But The Combatants On Board The Fleets Crying Out, “Health Attend You, Noble Emperor! We, Who Are About To Peril Our Lives, Salute You;” And He Replying, “Health Attend You Too,” They All Refused To Fight, As If By That Response He Had Meant To Excuse Them. Upon This, He Hesitated For A Time, Whether He Should Not Destroy Them All With Fire And Sword. At Last, Leaping From His Seat, And Running Along The Shore Of The Lake With Tottering Steps, The Result Of His Foul Excesses, He, Partly By Fair Words, And Partly By Threats, Persuaded Them To Engage. This Spectacle Represented An Engagement Between The Fleets Of Sicily And Rhodes; Consisting Each Of Twelve Ships Of War, Of Three Banks Of Oars. The Signal For The Encounter Was Given By A Silver Triton, Raised By Machinery From The Middle Of The Lake.</a> <span class="flex">637</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="638">Xxii. With Regard To Religious Ceremonies, The Administration Of Affairs Both Civil And Military, And The Condition Of All Orders Of The People At Home And Abroad, Some Practices He Corrected, Others Which Had Been Laid Aside He Revived; And Some Regulations He Introduced Which Were Entirely New. In Appointing New Priests For The Several Colleges, He Made No Appointments Without Being Sworn. When An Earthquake  Happened In The City, He Never Failed To Summon The People Together By The Praetor, And Appoint Holidays For Sacred Rites. And Upon The Sight Of Any Ominous Bird In The City Or Capitol, He Issued An Order For A Supplication, The Words Of Which, By Virtue Of His Office Of High Priest, After An Exhortation From The Rostra, He Recited In The Presence Of The People, Who Repeated Them After Him; All Workmen And Slaves Being First Ordered To Withdraw.</a> <span class="flex">638</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="639">Xxiii. The Courts Of Judicature, Whose Sittings Had Been Formerly Divided Between The Summer And Winter Months, He Ordered, For The Dispatch Of Business, To Sit The Whole Year Round. The Jurisdiction In Matters Of Trust, Which Used To Be Granted Annually By Special Commission To Certain Magistrates, And In The City Only, He Made Permanent, And Extended To The Provincial Judges Likewise. He Altered A Clause Added By Tiberius To The Papia-poppaean Law , Which Inferred That Men Of Sixty Years Of Age Were Incapable Of Begetting Children. He Ordered That, Out Of The Ordinary Course Of Proceeding, Orphans Might Have Guardians Appointed Them By The Consuls; And That Those Who Were Banished From Any Province By The Chief Magistrate, Should Be Debarred From Coming Into The City, Or Any Part Of Italy. He Inflicted On Certain Persons A New Sort Of Banishment, By Forbidding Them To Depart Further Than Three Miles From Rome. When Any Affair Of Importance Came Before The Senate, He Used To Sit Between The Two Consuls Upon The Seats Of The Tribunes. He Reserved To Himself The Power Of Granting License To Travel Out Of Italy, Which Before Had Belonged To The Senate.</a> <span class="flex">639</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="640">Xxiv. He Likewise Granted The Consular Ornaments To His Ducenarian Procurators. From Those Who Declined The Senatorian Dignity, He Took Away The Equestrian. Although He Had In The Beginning Of His Reign Declared, That He Would Admit No Man Into The Senate Who Was Not The Great-grandson Of A Roman Citizen, Yet He Gave The “Broad Hem” To The Son Of A Freedman, On Condition That He Should Be Adopted By A Roman Knight. Being Afraid, However, Of Incurring Censure By Such An Act, He Informed The Public, That His Ancestor Appius Caecus, The Censor, Had Elected The Sons Of Freedmen Into  The Senate; For He Was Ignorant, It Seems, That In The Times Of Appius, And A Long While Afterwards, Persons Manumitted Were Not Called Freedmen, But Only Their Sons Who Were Free-born. Instead Of The Expense Which The College Of Quaestors Was Obliged To Incur In Paving The High-ways, He Ordered Them To Give The People An Exhibition Of Gladiators; And Relieving Them Of The Provinces Of Ostia And [Cisalpine] Gaul, He Reinstated Them In The Charge Of The Treasury, Which, Since It Was Taken From Them, Had Been Managed By The Praetors, Or Those Who Had Formerly Filled That Office. He Gave The Triumphal Ornaments To Silanus, Who Was Betrothed To His Daughter, Though He Was Under Age; And In Other Cases, He Bestowed Them On So Many, And With So Little Reserve, That There Is Extant A Letter Unanimously Addressed To Him By All The Legions, Begging Him “To Grant His Consular Lieutenants The Triumphal Ornaments At The Time Of Their Appointment To Commands, In Order To Prevent Their Seeking Occasion To Engage In Unnecessary Wars.” He Decreed To Aulus Plautius The Honour Of An Ovation , Going To Meet Him At His Entering The City, And Walking With Him In The Procession To The Capitol, And Back, In Which He Took The Left Side, Giving Him The Post Of Honour. He Allowed Gabinius Secundus, Upon His Conquest Of The Chauci, A German Tribe, To Assume The Cognomen Of Chaucius.</a> <span class="flex">640</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="641">Xxv. His Military Organization Of The Equestrian Order Was This. After Having The Command Of A Cohort, They Were Promoted To A Wing Of Auxiliary Horse, And Subsequently Received The Commission Of Tribune Of A Legion. He Raised A Body Of Militia, Who Were Called Supernumeraries, Who, Though They Were A Sort Of Soldiers, And Kept In Reserve, Yet Received Pay. He Procured An Act Of The Senate To Prohibit All Soldiers From Attending Senators At Their Houses, In The Way Of Respect And Compliment. He Confiscated The Estates Of All Freedmen Who Presumed To Take Upon Themselves The Equestrian Rank. Such Of Them As Were Ungrateful To Their Patrons, And Were Complained Of By Them, He Reduced To Their Former Condition Of  From The Senate And People Of Rome To King Seleucus , On Which They Promised Him Their Friendship And Alliance, Provided That He Would Grant Their Kinsmen The Iliensians Immunity From All Burdens.</a> <span class="flex">641</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="644">Xxvi. He Was Twice Married At A Very Early Age, First To Aemilia Lepida, The Grand-daughter Of Augustus, And Afterwards To Livia Medullina, Who Had The Cognomen Of Camilla, And Was Descended From The Old Dictator Camillus. The Former He Divorced While Still A Virgin, Because Her Parents Had Incurred The Displeasure Of Augustus; And He Lost The Latter By Sickness On The Day Fixed For Their Nuptials. He Next Married Plautia Urgulanilla, Whose Father Had Enjoyed The Honour Of A Triumph; And Soon Afterwards, Aelia Paetina, The Daughter Of A Man Of Consular Rank. But He Divorced Them Both; Paetina, Upon Some Trifling Causes Of Disgust; And Urgulanilla, For Scandalous Lewdness, And The Suspicion Of Murder. After Them He Took In Marriage Valeria Messalina, The Daughter Of Barbatus Messala, His Cousin. But Finding That, Besides Her Other Shameful Debaucheries, She Had Even Gone So Far As To Marry In His Own Absence Caius Silius, The Settlement Of Her Dower Being Formally Signed, In The Presence Of The Augurs, He Put Her To Death. When Summoning His Pretorians To His Presence, He Made To Them This Declaration: “As I Have Been So Unhappy In My Unions, I Am Resolved To Continue In Future Unmarried; And If I Should Not, I Give You Leave To Stab Me.” He Was, However, Unable To Persist In This Resolution; For He Began Immediately To Think Of Another Wife; And Even Of Taking Back Paetina, Whom He Had Formerly Divorced: He Thought Also Of Lollia Paulina, Who Had Been Married To Caius Caesar. But Being Ensnared By The Arts Of Agrippina,  The Daughter Of His Brother Germanicus, Who Took Advantage Of The Kisses And Endearments Which Their Near Relationship Admitted, To Inflame His Desires, He Got Some One To Propose At The Next Meeting Of The Senate, That They Should Oblige The Emperor To Marry Agrippina, As A Measure Highly Conducive To The Public Interest; And That In Future Liberty Should Be Given For Such Marriages, Which Until That Time Had Been Considered Incestuous. In Less Than Twenty-four Hours After This, He Married Her . No Person Was Found, However, To Follow The Example, Excepting One Freedman, And A Centurion Of The First Rank, At The Solemnization Of Whose Nuptials Both He And Agrippina Attended.</a> <span class="flex">644</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="645">Xxvii. He Had Children By Three Of His Wives: By Urgulanilla, Drusus And Claudia; By Paetina, Antonia; And By Messalina, Octavia, And Also A Son, Whom At First He Called Germanicus, But Afterwards Britannicus. He Lost Drusus At Pompeii, When He Was Very Young; He Being Choked With A Pear, Which In His Play He Tossed Into The Air, And Caught In His Mouth. Only A Few Days Before, He Had Betrothed Him To One Of Sejanus’s Daughters ; And I Am Therefore Surprised That Some Authors Should Say He Lost His Life By The Treachery Of Sejanus. Claudia, Who Was, In Truth, The Daughter Of Boter His Freedman, Though She Was Born Five Months Before His Divorce, He Ordered To Be Thrown Naked At Her Mother’s Door. He Married Antonia To Cneius Pompey The Great , And Afterwards To Faustus Sylla , Both Youths Of Very Noble Parentage; Octavia To His Step-son Nero , After She Had Been Contracted To Silanus. Britannicus Was Born Upon The Twentieth Day Of His Reign, And In His Second Consulship. He Often Earnestly Commended Him To The Soldiers, Holding Him In His Arms Before Their Ranks; And Would Likewise Show Him To The People In The Theatre, Setting Him Upon His Lap, Or Holding Him Out Whilst He Was Still Very Young; And Was Sure To Receive Their Acclamations, And Good Wishes On His Behalf. Of His  Sons-in-law, He Adopted Nero. He Not Only Dismissed From His Favour Both Pompey And Silanus, But Put Them To Death.</a> <span class="flex">645</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="646">Xxviii. Amongst His Freedmen, The Greatest Favourite Was The Eunuch Posides, Whom, In His British Triumph, He Presented With The Pointless Spear, Classing Him Among The Military Men. Next To Him, If Not Equal, In Favour Was Felix , Whom He Not Only Preferred To Commands Both Of Cohorts And Troops, But To The Government Of The Province Of Judaea; And He Became, In Consequence Of His Elevation, The Husband Of Three Queens . Another Favourite Was Harpocras, To Whom He Granted The Privilege Of Being Carried In A Litter Within The City, And Of Holding Public Spectacles For The Entertainment Of The People. In This Class Was Likewise Polybius, Who Assisted Him In His Studies, And Had Often The Honour Of Walking Between The Two Consuls. But Above All Others, Narcissus, His Secretary, And Pallas , The Comptroller Of His Accounts, Were In High Favour With Him. He Not Only Allowed Them To Receive, By Decree Of The Senate, Immense Presents, But Also To Be Decorated With The Quaestorian And Praetorian Ensigns Of Honour. So Much Did He Indulge Them In Amassing Wealth, And Plundering The Public, That, Upon His Complaining, Once, Of The Lowness Of His Exchequer, Some One Said, With Great Reason, That “It Would Be Full Enough, If Those Two Freedmen Of His Would But Take Him Into Partnership With Them.”</a> <span class="flex">646</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="647">Xxix. Being Entirely Governed By These Freedmen, And, As I Have Already Said, By His Wives, He Was A Tool To Others, Rather Than A Prince. He Distributed Offices, Or The Command Of Armies, Pardoned Or Punished, According As It Suited Their Interests,  Their Passions, Or Their Caprice; And For The Most Part, Without Knowing, Or Being Sensible Of What He Did. Not To Enter Into Minute Details Relative To The Revocation Of Grants, The Reversal Of Judicial Decisions, Obtaining His Signature To Fictitious Appointments, Or The Bare-faced Alteration Of Them After Signing; He Put To Death Appius Silanus, The Father Of His Son-in-law, And The Two Julias, The Daughters Of Drusus And Germanicus, Without Any Positive Proof Of The Crimes With Which They Were Charged, Or So Much As Permitting Them To Make Any Defence. He Also Cut Off Cneius Pompey, The Husband Of His Eldest Daughter; And Lucius Silanus, Who Was Betrothed To The Younger Pompey, Was Stabbed In The Act Of Unnatural Lewdness With A Favourite Paramour. Silanus Was Obliged To Quit The Office Of Praetor Upon The Fourth Of The Calends Of January [29Th Dec.], And To Kill Himself On New Year’s Day  Following, The Very Same On Which Claudius And Agrippina Were Married. He Condemned To Death Five And Thirty Senators, And Above Three Hundred Roman Knights, With So Little Attention To What He Did, That When A Centurion Brought Him Word Of The Execution Of A Man Of Consular Rank, Who Was One Of The Number, And Told Him That He Had Executed His Order, He Declared, “He Had Ordered No Such Thing, But That He Approved Of It;” Because His Freedmen, It Seems, Had Said, That The Soldiers Did Nothing More Than Their Duty, In Dispatching The Emperor’s Enemies Without Waiting For A Warrant. But It Is Beyond All Belief, That He Himself, At The Marriage Of Messalina With The Adulterous Silius, Should Actually Sign The Writings Relative To Her Dowry; Induced, As It Is Pretended, By The Design Of Diverting From Himself And Transferring Upon Another The Danger Which Some Omens Seemed To Threaten Him.</a> <span class="flex">647</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="648">Xxx. Either Standing Or Sitting, But Especially When He Lay Asleep, He Had A Majestic And Graceful Appearance; For He Was Tall, But Not Slender. His Grey Looks Became Him Well, And He Had A Full Neck. But His Knees Were Feeble, And Failed Him In Walking, So That His Gait Was Ungainly, Both When He Assumed State, And When He Was Taking Diversion. He Was Outrageous In His Laughter, And Still More So In His Wrath, For Then He Foamed At The Mouth, And Discharged From His Nostrils. He Also Stammered In His Speech, And Had A Tremulous Motion  Of The Head At All Times, But Particularly When He Was Engaged In Any Business, However Trifling.</a> <span class="flex">648</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="649">Xxxi. Though His Health Was Very Infirm During The Former Part Of His Life, Yet, After He Became Emperor, He Enjoyed A Good State Of Health, Except Only That He Was Subject To A Pain Of The Stomach. In A Fit Of This Complaint, He Said He Had Thoughts Of Killing Himself.</a> <span class="flex">649</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="650">Xxxii. He Gave Entertainments As Frequent As They Were Splendid, And Generally When There Was Such Ample Room, That Very Often Six Hundred Guests Sat Down Together. At A Feast He Gave On The Banks Of The Canal For Draining The Fucine Lake, He Narrowly Escaped Being Drowned, The Water At Its Discharge Rushing Out With Such Violence, That It Overflowed The Conduit. At Supper He Had Always His Own Children, With Those Of Several Of The Nobility, Who, According To An Ancient Custom, Sat At The Feet Of The Couches. One Of His Guests Having Been Suspected Of Purloining A Golden Cup, He Invited Him Again The Next Day, But Served Him With A Porcelain Jug. It Is Said, Too, That He Intended To Publish An Edict, “Allowing To All People The Liberty Of Giving Vent At Table To Any Distension Occasioned By Flatulence,” Upon Hearing Of A Person Whose Modesty, When Under Restraint, Had Nearly Cost Him His Life.</a> <span class="flex">650</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="651">Xxxiii. He Was Always Ready To Eat And Drink At Any Time Or In Any Place. One Day, As He Was Hearing Causes In The Forum Of Augustus, He Smelt The Dinner Which Was Preparing For The Salii , In The Temple Of Mars Adjoining, Whereupon He Quitted  The Tribunal, And Went To Partake Of The Feast With The Priests.</a> <span class="flex">651</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="653">Xxxiv. His Cruel And Sanguinary Disposition Was Exhibited Upon Great As Well As Trifling Occasions. When Any Person Was To Be Put To The Torture, Or Criminal Punished For Parricide, He Was Impatient For The Execution, And Would Have It Performed In His Own Presence. When He Was At Tibur, Being Desirous Of Seeing An Example Of The Old Way Of Putting Malefactors To Death, Some Were Immediately Bound To A Stake For The Purpose; But There Being No Executioner To Be Had At The Place, He Sent For One From Rome, And Waited For His Coming Until Night. In Any Exhibition Of Gladiators, Presented Either By Himself Or Others, If Any Of The Combatants Chanced To Fall, He Ordered Them To Be Butchered, Especially The Retiarii, That He Might See Their Faces In The Agonies Of Death. Two Gladiators Happening To Kill Each Other, He Immediately Ordered Some Little Knives To Be Made Of Their Swords For His Own Use. He Took Great Pleasure In Seeing Men Engage With Wild Beasts, And The Combatants Who Appeared On The Stage At Noon. He Would Therefore Come To The Theatre By Break Of Day, And At Noon, Dismissing The People To Dinner, Continued Sitting Himself; And Besides Those Who Were Devoted To That Sanguinary Fate, He Would Match Others With The Beasts, Upon Slight Or Sudden Occasions; As, For Instance, The Carpenters And Their  Assistants, And People Of That Sort, If A Machine, Or Any Piece Of Work In Which They Had Been Employed About The Theatre Did Not Answer The Purpose For Which It Had Been Intended. To This Desperate Kind Of Encounter He Forced One Of His Nomenclators, Even Encumbered As He Was By Wearing The Toga.</a> <span class="flex">653</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="654">Xxxv. But The Characteristics Most Predominant In Him Were Fear And Distrust. In The Beginning Of His Reign, Though He Much Affected A Modest And Humble Appearance, As Has Been Already Observed, Yet He Durst Not Venture Himself At An Entertainment Without Being Attended By A Guard Of Spearmen, And Made Soldiers Wait Upon Him At Table Instead Of Servants. He Never Visited A Sick Person, Until The Chamber Had Been First Searched, And The Bed And Bedding Thoroughly Examined. At Other Times, All Persons Who Came To Pay Their Court To Him Were Strictly Searched By Officers Appointed For That Purpose; Nor Was It Until After A Long Time, And With Much Difficulty, That He Was Prevailed Upon To Excuse Women, Boys, And Girls From Such Rude Handling, Or Suffer Their Attendants Or Writing-masters To Retain Their Cases For Pens And Styles. When Camillus Formed His Plot Against Him, Not Doubting But His Timidity Might Be Worked Upon Without A War, He Wrote To Him A Scurrilous, Petulant, And Threatening Letter, Desiring Him To Resign The Government, And Betake Himself To A Life Of Privacy. Upon Receiving This Requisition, He Had Some Thoughts Of Complying With It, And Summoned Together The Principal Men Of The City, To Consult With Them On The Subject.</a> <span class="flex">654</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="655">Xxxvi. Having Heard Some Loose Reports Of Conspiracies Formed Against Him, He Was So Much Alarmed, That He Thought Of Immediately Abdicating The Government. And When, As I Have Before Related, A Man Armed With A Dagger Was Discovered Near Him While He Was Sacrificing, He Instantly Ordered The Heralds To Convoke The Senate, And With Tears And Dismal Exclamations, Lamented That Such Was His Condition, That He Was Safe No Where; And For A Long Time Afterwards He Abstained From Appearing In Public. He Smothered His Ardent Love For Messalina, Not So Much On Account Of Her Infamous Conduct, As From Apprehension Of Danger; Believing That She Aspired To Share With Silius, Her Partner In Adultery, The Imperial Dignity.  Upon This Occasion He Ran In A Great Fright, And A Very Shameful Manner, To The Camp, Asking All The Way He Went, “If The Empire Were Indeed Safely His?”</a> <span class="flex">655</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="656">Xxxvii. No Suspicion Was Too Trifling, No Person On Whom It Rested Too Contemptible, To Throw Him Into A Panic, And Induce Him To Take Precautions For His Safety, And Meditate Revenge. A Man Engaged In A Litigation Before His Tribunal, Having Saluted Him, Drew Him Aside, And Told Him He Had Dreamt That He Saw Him Murdered; And Shortly Afterwards, When His Adversary Came To Deliver His Plea To The Emperor, The Plaintiff, Pretending To Have Discovered The Murderer, Pointed To Him As The Man He Had Seen In His Dream; Whereupon, As If He Had Been Taken In The Act, He Was Hurried Away To Execution. We Are Informed, That Appius Silanus Was Got Rid Of In The Same Manner, By A Contrivance Betwixt Messalina And Narcissus, In Which They Had Their Several Parts Assigned Them. Narcissus Therefore Burst Into His Lord’s Chamber Before Daylight, Apparently In Great Fright, And Told Him That He Had Dreamt That Appius Silanus Had Murdered Him. The Empress, Upon This, Affecting Great Surprise, Declared She Had The Like Dream For Several Nights Successively. Presently Afterwards, Word Was Brought, As It Had Been Agreed On, That Appius Was Come, He Having, Indeed, Received Orders The Preceding Day To Be There At That Time; And, As If The Truth Of The Dream Was Sufficiently Confirmed By His Appearance At That Juncture, He Was Immediately Ordered To Be Prosecuted And Put To Death. The Day Following, Claudius Related The Whole Affair To The Senate, And Acknowledged His Great Obligation To His Freedmen For Watching Over Him Even In His Sleep.</a> <span class="flex">656</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="657">Xxxviii. Sensible Of His Being Subject To Passion And Resentment, He Excused Himself In Both Instances By A Proclamation, Assuring The Public That “The Former Should Be Short And Harmless, And The Latter Never Without Good Cause.” After Severely Reprimanding The People Of Ostia For Not Sending Some Boats To Meet Him Upon His Entering The Mouth Of The Tiber, In Terms Which Might Expose Them To The Public Resentment, He Wrote To Rome That He Had Been Treated As A Private Person; Yet Immediately Afterwards He Pardoned Them, And That In A Way Which Had The Appearance Of Making Them  Satisfaction, Or Begging Pardon For Some Injury He Had Done Them. Some People Who Addressed Him Unseasonably In Public, He Pushed Away With His Own Hand. He Likewise Banished A Person Who Had Been Secretary To A Quaestor, And Even A Senator Who Had Filled The Office Of Praetor, Without A Hearing, And Although They Were Innocent; The Former Only Because He Had Treated Him With Rudeness While He Was In A Private Station, And The Other, Because In His Aedileship He Had Fined Some Tenants Of His, For Selling Cooked Victuals Contrary To Law, And Ordered His Steward, Who Interfered, To Be Whipped. On This Account, Likewise, He Took From The Aediles The Jurisdiction They Had Over Cooks’-shops. He Did Not Scruple To Speak Of His Own Absurdities, And Declared In Some Short Speeches Which He Published, That He Had Only Feigned Imbecility In The Reign Of Caius, Because Otherwise It Would Have Been Impossible For Him To Have Escaped And Arrived At The Station He Had Then Attained. He Could Not, However, Gain Credit For This Assertion; For A Short Time Afterwards, A Book Was Published Under The Title Of Moron Anastasis, “The Resurrection Of Fools,” The Design Of Which Was To Show “That Nobody Ever Counterfeited Folly.”</a> <span class="flex">657</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="658">Xxxix. Amongst Other Things, People Admired In Him His Indifference And Unconcern; Or, To Express It In Greek, His Meteoria And Ablepsia. Placing Himself At Table A Little After Messalina’s Death, He Enquired, “Why The Empress Did Not Come?” Many Of Those Whom He Had Condemned To Death, He Ordered The Day After To Be Invited To His Table, And To Game With Him, And Sent To Reprimand Them As Sluggish Fellows For Not Making Greater Haste. When He Was Meditating His Incestuous Marriage With Agrippina, He Was Perpetually Calling Her, “My Daughter, My Nursling, Born And Brought Up Upon My Lap.” And When He Was Going To Adopt Nero, As If There Was Little Cause For Censure In His Adopting A Son-in-law, When He Had A Son Of His Own Arrived At Years Of Maturity; He Continually Gave Out In Public, “That No One Had Ever Been Admitted By Adoption Into The Claudian Family.”</a> <span class="flex">658</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="659">Xl. He Frequently Appeared So Careless In What He Said, And So Inattentive To Circumstances, That It Was Believed He Never Reflected Who He Himself Was, Or Amongst Whom, Or At  What Time, Or In What Place, He Spoke. In A Debate In The Senate Relative To The Butchers And Vintners, He Cried Out, “I Ask You, Who Can Live Without A Bit Of Meat?” And Mentioned The Great Plenty Of Old Taverns, From Which He Himself Used Formerly To Have His Wine. Among Other Reasons For His Supporting A Certain Person Who Was Candidate For The Quaestorship, He Gave This: “His Father,” Said He, “Once Gave Me, Very Seasonably, A Draught Of Cold Water When I Was Sick.” Upon His Bringing A Woman As A Witness In Some Cause Before The Senate, He Said, “This Woman Was My Mother’s Freedwoman And Dresser, But She Always Considered Me As Her Master; And This I Say, Because There Are Some Still In My Family That Do Not Look Upon Me As Such.” The People Of Ostia Addressing Him In Open Court With A Petition, He Flew Into A Rage At Them, And Said, “There Is No Reason Why I Should Oblige You: If Any One Else Is Free To Act As He Pleases, Surely I Am.” The Following Expressions He Had In His Mouth Every Day, And At All Hours And Seasons: “What! Do You Take Me For A Theogonius?”  And In Greek Lalei Kai Mae Thingane, “Speak, But Do Not Touch Me;” Besides Many Other Familiar Sentences, Below The Dignity Of A Private Person, Much More Of An Emperor, Who Was Not Deficient Either In Eloquence Or Learning, As Having Applied Himself Very Closely To The Liberal Sciences.</a> <span class="flex">659</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="660">Xli. By The Encouragement Of Titus Livius , And With The Assistance Of Sulpicius Flavus, He Attempted At An Early Age The Composition Of A History; And Having Called Together A Numerous Auditory, To Hear And Give Their Judgment Upon It, He Read It Over With Much Difficulty, And Frequently Interrupting Himself. For After He Had Begun, A Great Laugh Was Raised Amongst The Company, By The Breaking Of Several Benches From The Weight Of A Very Fat Man; And Even When Order Was Restored, He Could Not Forbear Bursting Out Into Violent Fits Of Laughter, At The Remembrance Of The Accident. After He Became Emperor, Likewise, He Wrote Several Things  Which He Was Careful To Have Recited To His Friends By A Reader. He Commenced His History From The Death Of The Dictator Caesar; But Afterwards He Took A Later Period, And Began At The Conclusion Of The Civil Wars; Because He Found He Could Not Speak With Freedom, And A Due Regard To Truth, Concerning The Former Period, Having Been Often Taken To Task Both By His Mother And Grandmother. Of The Earlier History He Left Only Two Books, But Of The Latter, One And Forty. He Compiled Likewise The “History Of His Own Life,” In Eight Books, Full Of Absurdities, But In No Bad Style; Also, “A Defence Of Cicero Against The Books Of Asinius Gallus,”  Which Exhibited A Considerable Degree Of Learning. He Besides Invented Three New Letters, And Added Them To The Former Alphabet , As Highly Necessary. He Published A Book To Recommend Them While He Was Yet Only A Private Person; But On His Elevation To Imperial Power He Had Little Difficulty In Introducing Them Into Common Use; And These Letters Are Still Extant In A Variety Of Books, Registers, And Inscriptions Upon Buildings.</a> <span class="flex">660</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="661">Xlii. He Applied Himself With No Less Attention To The Study Of Grecian Literature, Asserting Upon All Occasions His Love Of That Language, And Its Surpassing Excellency. A Stranger Once Holding A Discourse Both In Greek And Latin, He Addressed Him Thus; “Since You Are Skilled In Both Our Tongues.” And Recommending Achaia To The Favour Of The Senate, He Said, “I Have A Particular Attachment To That Province, On Account Of Our Common Studies.” In The Senate He Often Made Long Replies To Ambassadors In That Language. On The Tribunal He Frequently Quoted The Verses Of Homer. When At Any Time He Had Taken Vengeance On An Enemy Or A Conspirator, He Scarcely Ever Gave To The Tribune On Guard, Who,  According To Custom, Came For The Word, Any Other Than This.</a> <span class="flex">661</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="663">Xliii. Towards The Close Of His Life, He Gave Some Manifest Indications That He Repented Of His Marriage With Agrippina, And His Adoption Of Nero. For Some Of His Freedmen Noticing With Approbation His Having Condemned, The Day Before, A Woman Accused Of Adultery, He Remarked, “It Has Been My Misfortune To Have Wives Who Have Been Unfaithful To My Bed; But They Did Not Escape Punishment.” Often, When He Happened To Meet Britannicus, He Would Embrace Him Tenderly, And Express A Desire “That He Might Grow Apace,” And Receive From Him An Account Of All His Actions: Using The Greek Phrase, “O Trosas Kai Iasetai,—he Who Has Wounded Will Also Heal.” And Intending To Give Him The Manly Habit, While He Was Yet Under Age And A Tender Youth, Because His Stature Would Allow Of It, He Added, “I Do So, That The Roman People May At Last Have A Real Caesar.”</a> <span class="flex">663</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="664">Xliv. Soon Afterwards He Made His Will, And Had It Signed By All The Magistrates As Witnesses. But He Was Prevented From Proceeding Further By Agrippina, Accused By Her Own Guilty Conscience, As Well As By Informers, Of A Variety Of Crimes. It Is Agreed That He Was Taken Off By Poison; But Where, And By Whom Administered, Remains In Uncertainty. Some Authors Say That It Was Given Him As He Was Feasting With The Priests In The Capitol, By The Eunuch Halotus, His Taster. Others Say  By Agrippina, At His Own Table, In Mushrooms, A Dish Of Which He Was Very Fond . The Accounts Of What Followed Likewise Differ. Some Relate That He Instantly Became Speechless, Was Racked With Pain Through The Night, And Died About Day-break; Others, That At First He Fell Into A Sound Sleep, And Afterwards, His Food Rising, He Threw Up The Whole; But Had Another Dose Given Him; Whether In Water-gruel, Under Pretence Of Refreshment After His Exhaustion, Or In A Clyster, As If Designed To Relieve His Bowels, Is Likewise Uncertain.</a> <span class="flex">664</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="665">Xlv. His Death Was Kept Secret Until Everything Was Settled Relative To His Successor. Accordingly, Vows Were Made For His Recovery, And Comedians Were Called To Amuse Him, As It Was Pretended, By His Own Desire. He Died Upon The Third Of The Ides Of October [13Th October], In The Consulship Of Asinius Marcellus And Acilius Aviola, In The Sixty-fourth Year Of His Age, And The Fourteenth Of His Reign . His Funeral Was Celebrated With The Customary Imperial Pomp, And He Was Ranked Amongst The Gods. This Honour Was Taken From Him By Nero, But Restored By Vespasian.</a> <span class="flex">665</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="666">Xlvi. The Chief Presages Of His Death Were, The Appearance Of A Comet, His Father Drusus’s Monument Being Struck By Lightning, And The Death Of Most Of The Magistrates Of All Ranks That Year. It Appears From Several Circumstances, That He Was Sensible Of His Approaching Dissolution, And Made No Secret Of It. For When He Nominated The Consuls, He Appointed No One To Fill The Office Beyond The Month In Which He Died. At The Last Assembly Of The Senate In Which He Made His Appearance, He Earnestly Exhorted His Two Sons To Unity With Each Other, And With Earnest Entreaties Commended To The Fathers The Care Of Their Tender Years. And In The Last Cause He Heard From The Tribunal, He Repeatedly Declared In Open Court, “That He Was Now Arrived At The Last Stage Of Mortal Existence;” Whilst All Who Heard It Shrunk At Hearing These Ominous Words.</a> <span class="flex">666</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="682">Nero Claudius Caesar.</a> <span class="flex">682</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="683">I. Two Celebrated Families, The Calvini And Aenobarbi, Sprung From The Race Of The Domitii. The Aenobarbi Derive Both Their Extraction And Their Cognomen From One Lucius Domitius, Of Whom We Have This Tradition: —As He Was Returning Out Of The Country To Rome, He Was Met By Two Young Men Of A Most August Appearance, Who Desired Him To Announce To The Senate And People A Victory, Of Which No Certain Intelligence Had Yet Reached The City. To Prove That They Were More Than Mortals, They Stroked His Cheeks, And Thus Changed His Hair, Which Was Black, To A Bright Colour, Resembling That Of Brass; Which Mark Of Distinction Descended To His Posterity, For They Had Generally Red Beards. This Family Had The Honour Of Seven Consulships , One Triumph , And Two Censorships ; And Being Admitted Into The Patrician Order, They Continued The Use Of The Same Cognomen, With No Other Praenomina  Than Those Of Cneius And Lucius. These, However, They Assumed With Singular Irregularity; Three Persons In Succession Sometimes Adhering To One Of Them, And Then They Were Changed Alternately. For The First, Second, And Third Of The Aenobarbi Had The Praenomen Of Lucius, And Again The Three Following, Successively, That Of Cneius, While Those Who Came After Were Called, By Turns, One, Lucius, And The Other, Cneius. It Appears To Me Proper To Give A Short Account Of Several Of The Family, To Show That Nero So Far Degenerated From The Noble Qualities Of His Ancestors, That He Retained Only Their Vices; As If Those Alone Had Been Transmitted To Him By His Descent.</a> <span class="flex">683</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="684">Ii. To Begin, Therefore, At A Remote Period, His Great-grandfather’s Grandfather, Cneius Domitius, When He Was Tribune Of The People, Being Offended With The High Priests For Electing Another Than Himself In The Room Of His Father, Obtained The  Transfer Of The Right Of Election From The Colleges Of The Priests To The People. In His Consulship , Having Conquered The Allobroges And The Arverni , He Made A Progress Through The Province, Mounted Upon An Elephant, With A Body Of Soldiers Attending Him, In A Sort Of Triumphal Pomp. Of This Person The Orator Licinius Crassus Said, “It Was No Wonder He Had A Brazen Beard, Who Had A Face Of Iron, And A Heart Of Lead.” His Son, During His Praetorship , Proposed That Cneius Caesar, Upon The Expiration Of His Consulship, Should Be Called To Account Before The Senate For His Administration Of That Office, Which Was Supposed To Be Contrary Both To The Omens And The Laws. Afterwards, When He Was Consul Himself , He Tried To Deprive Cneius Of The Command Of The Army, And Having Been, By Intrigue And Cabal, Appointed His Successor, He Was Made Prisoner At Corsinium, In The Beginning Of The Civil War. Being Set At Liberty, He Went To Marseilles, Which Was Then Besieged; Where Having, By His Presence, Animated The People To Hold Out, He Suddenly Deserted Them, And At Last Was Slain In The Battle Of Pharsalia. He Was A Man Of Little Constancy, And Of A Sullen Temper. In Despair Of His Fortunes, He Had Recourse To Poison, But Was So Terrified At The Thoughts Of Death, That, Immediately Repenting, He Took A Vomit To Throw It Up Again, And Gave Freedom To His Physician For Having, With Great Prudence And Wisdom, Given Him Only A Gentle Dose Of The Poison. When Cneius Pompey Was Consulting With His Friends In What Manner He Should Conduct Himself Towards Those Who Were Neuter And Took No Part In The Contest, He Was The Only One Who Proposed That They Should Be Treated As Enemies.</a> <span class="flex">684</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="685">Iii. He Left A Son, Who Was, Without Doubt, The Best Of The Family. By The Pedian Law, He Was Condemned, Although Innocent, Amongst Others Who Were Concerned In The Death Of Caesar . Upon This, He Went Over To Brutus And Cassius, His Near Relations; And, After Their Death, Not Only Kept Together The Fleet, The Command Of Which Had Been Given Him Some Time Before, But Even Increased It. At Last, When The Party Had Everywhere Been Defeated, He Voluntarily Surrendered It To  Mark Antony; Considering It As A Piece Of Service For Which The Latter Owed Him No Small Obligations. Of All Those Who Were Condemned By The Law Above-mentioned, He Was The Only Man Who Was Restored To His Country, And Filled The Highest Offices. When The Civil War Again Broke Out, He Was Appointed Lieutenant Under The Same Antony, And Offered The Chief Command By Those Who Were Ashamed Of Cleopatra; But Not Daring, On Account Of A Sudden Indisposition With Which He Was Seized, Either To Accept Or Refuse It, He Went Over To Augustus , And Died A Few Days After, Not Without An Aspersion Cast Upon His Memory. For Antony Gave Out, That He Was Induced To Change Sides By His Impatience To Be With His Mistress, Servilia Nais.</a> <span class="flex">685</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="686">Iv. This Cneius Had A Son, Named Domitius, Who Was Afterwards Well Known As The Nominal Purchaser Of The Family Property Left By Augustus’s Will ; And No Less Famous In His Youth For His Dexterity In Chariot-driving, Than He Was Afterwards For The Triumphal Ornaments Which He Obtained In The German War. But He Was A Man Of Great Arrogance, Prodigality, And Cruelty. When He Was Aedile, He Obliged Lucius Plancus, The Censor, To Give Him The Way; And In His Praetorship, And Consulship, He Made Roman Knights And Married Women Act On The Stage. He Gave Hunts Of Wild Beasts, Both In The Circus And In All The Wards Of The City; As Also A Show Of Gladiators; But With Such Barbarity, That Augustus, After Privately Reprimanding Him, To No Purpose, Was Obliged To Restrain Him By A Public Edict.</a> <span class="flex">686</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="687">V. By The Elder Antonia He Had Nero’s Father, A Man Of Execrable Character In Every Part Of His Life. During His Attendance Upon Caius Caesar In The East, He Killed A Freedman Of His Own, For Refusing To Drink As Much As He Ordered Him. Being Dismissed For This From Caesar’s Society, He Did Not Mend His Habits; For, In A Village Upon The Appian Road, He Suddenly Whipped His Horses, And Drove His Chariot, On Purpose,  Over A Poor Boy, Crushing Him To Pieces. At Rome, He Struck Out The Eye Of A Roman Knight In The Forum, Only For Some Free Language In A Dispute Between Them. He Was Likewise So Fraudulent, That He Not Only Cheated Some Silversmiths  Of The Price Of Goods He Had Bought Of Them, But, During His Praetorship, Defrauded The Owners Of Chariots In The Circensian Games Of The Prizes Due To Them For Their Victory. His Sister, Jeering Him For The Complaints Made By The Leaders Of The Several Parties, He Agreed To Sanction A Law, “That, For The Future, The Prizes Should Be Immediately Paid.” A Little Before The Death Of Tiberius, He Was Prosecuted For Treason, Adulteries, And Incest With His Sister Lepida, But Escaped In The Timely Change Of Affairs, And Died Of A Dropsy, At Pyrgi ; Leaving Behind Him His Son, Nero, Whom He Had By Agrippina, The Daughter Of Germanicus.</a> <span class="flex">687</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="688">Vi. Nero Was Born At Antium, Nine Months After The Death Of Tiberius , Upon The Eighteenth Of The Calends Of January [15Th December], Just As The Sun Rose, So That Its Beams Touched Him Before They Could Well Reach The Earth. While Many Fearful Conjectures, In Respect To His Future Fortune, Were Formed By Different Persons, From The Circumstances Of His Nativity, A Saying Of His Father, Domitius, Was Regarded As An Ill Presage, Who Told His Friends Who Were Congratulating Him Upon The Occasion, “That Nothing But What Was Detestable, And Pernicious To The Public, Could Ever Be Produced Of Him And Agrippina.” Another Manifest Prognostic Of His Future Infelicity Occurred Upon His Lustration Day . For Caius Caesar Being Requested By His Sister To Give The Child What Name He Thought Proper—looking At His Uncle, Claudius, Who  Afterwards, When Emperor, Adopted Nero, He Gave His: And This Not Seriously, But Only In Jest; Agrippina Treating It With Contempt, Because Claudius At That Time Was A Mere Laughing-stock At The Palace. He Lost His Father When He Was Three Years Old, Being Left Heir To A Third Part Of His Estate; Of Which He Never Got Possession, The Whole Being Seized By His Co-heir, Caius. His Mother Being Soon After Banished, He Lived With His Aunt Lepida, In A Very Necessitous Condition, Under The Care Of Two Tutors, A Dancing-master And A Barber. After Claudius Came To The Empire, He Not Only Recovered His Father’s Estate, But Was Enriched With The Additional Inheritance Of That Of His Step-father, Crispus Passienus. Upon His Mother’s Recall From Banishment, He Was Advanced To Such Favour, Through Nero’s Powerful Interest With The Emperor, That It Was Reported, Assassins Were Employed By Messalina, Claudius’s Wife, To Strangle Him, As Britannicus’s Rival, Whilst He Was Taking His Noon-day Repose. In Addition To The Story, It Was Said That They Were Frightened By A Serpent, Which Crept From Under His Cushion, And Ran Away. The Tale Was Occasioned By Finding On His Couch, Near The Pillow, The Skin Of A Snake, Which, By His Mother’s Order, He Wore For Some Time Upon His Right Arm, Inclosed In A Bracelet Of Gold. This Amulet, At Last, He Laid Aside, From Aversion To Her Memory; But He Sought For It Again, In Vain, In The Time Of His Extremity.</a> <span class="flex">688</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="689">Vii. When He Was Yet A Mere Boy, Before He Arrived At The Age Of Puberty, During The Celebration Of The Circensian Games , He Performed His Part In The Trojan Play With A Degree Of Firmness Which Gained Him Great Applause. In The Eleventh Year Of His Age, He Was Adopted By Claudius, And Placed Under The Tuition Of Annaeus Seneca , Who Had Been Made A Senator. It Is Said, That Seneca Dreamt The Night After, That He Was Giving A Lesson To Caius Caesar . Nero Soon Verified His Dream, Betraying The Cruelty Of His Disposition In Every Way He Could. For He Attempted To Persuade His Father That His Brother, Britannicus, Was Nothing But A Changeling, Because The Latter Had  Saluted Him, Notwithstanding His Adoption, By The Name Of Aenobarbus, As Usual. When His Aunt, Lepida, Was Brought To Trial, He Appeared In Court As A Witness Against Her, To Gratify His Mother, Who Persecuted The Accused. On His Introduction Into The Forum, At The Age Of Manhood, He Gave A Largess To The People And A Donative To The Soldiers: For The Pretorian Cohorts, He Appointed A Solemn Procession Under Arms, And Marched At The Head Of Them With A Shield In His Hand; After Which He Went To Return Thanks To His Father In The Senate. Before Claudius, Likewise, At The Time He Was Consul, He Made A Speech For The Bolognese, In Latin, And For The Rhodians And People Of Ilium, In Greek. He Had The Jurisdiction Of Praefect Of The City, For The First Time, During The Latin Festival; During Which The Most Celebrated Advocates Brought Before Him, Not Short And Trifling Causes, As Is Usual In That Case, But Trials Of Importance, Notwithstanding They Had Instructions From Claudius Himself To The Contrary. Soon Afterwards, He Married Octavia, And Exhibited The Circensian Games, And Hunting Of Wild Beasts, In Honour Of Claudius.</a> <span class="flex">689</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="690">Viii. He Was Seventeen Years Of Age At The Death Of That Prince , And As Soon As That Event Was Made Public, He Went Out To The Cohort On Guard Between The Hours Of Six And Seven; For The Omens Were So Disastrous, That No Earlier Time Of The Day Was Judged Proper. On The Steps Before The Palace Gate, He Was Unanimously Saluted By The Soldiers As Their Emperor, And Then Carried In A Litter To The Camp; Thence, After Making A Short Speech To The Troops, Into The Senate-house, Where He Continued Until The Evening; Of All The Immense Honours Which Were Heaped Upon Him, Refusing None But The Title Of Father Of His Country, On Account Of His Youth,</a> <span class="flex">690</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="691">Ix. He Began His Reign With An Ostentation Of Dutiful Regard To The Memory Of Claudius, Whom He Buried With The Utmost Pomp And Magnificence, Pronouncing The Funeral Oration Himself, And Then Had Him Enrolled Amongst The Gods. He Paid Likewise The Highest Honours To The Memory Of His Father Domitius. He Left The Management Of Affairs, Both Public And Private, To His Mother. The Word Which He Gave The First Day Of His Reign To The Tribune On Guard, Was, “The  Best Of Mothers,” And Afterwards He Frequently Appeared With Her In The Streets Of Rome In Her Litter. He Settled A Colony At Antium, In Which He Placed The Veteran Soldiers Belonging To The Guards; And Obliged Several Of The Richest Centurions Of The First Rank To Transfer Their Residence To That Place; Where He Likewise Made A Noble Harbour At A Prodigious Expense.</a> <span class="flex">691</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="692">X. To Establish Still Further His Character, He Declared, “That He Designed To Govern According To The Model Of Augustus;” And Omitted No Opportunity Of Showing His Generosity, Clemency, And Complaisance. The More Burthensome Taxes He Either Entirely Took Off, Or Diminished. The Rewards Appointed For Informers By The Papian Law, He Reduced To A Fourth Part, And Distributed To The People Four Hundred Sesterces A Man. To The Noblest Of The Senators Who Were Much Reduced In Their Circumstances, He Granted Annual Allowances, In Some Cases As Much As Five Hundred Thousand Sesterces; And To The Pretorian Cohorts A Monthly Allowance Of Corn Gratis. When Called Upon To Subscribe The Sentence, According To Custom, Of A Criminal Condemned To Die, “I Wish,” Said He, “I Had Never Learnt To Read And Write.” He Continually Saluted People Of The Several Orders By Name, Without A Prompter. When The Senate Returned Him Their Thanks For His Good Government, He Replied To Them, “It Will Be Time Enough To Do So When I Shall Have Deserved It.” He Admitted The Common People To See Him Perform His Exercises In The Campus Martius. He Frequently Declaimed In Public, And Recited Verses Of His Own Composing, Not Only At Home, But In The Theatre; So Much To The Joy Of All The People, That Public Prayers Were Appointed To Be Put Up To The Gods Upon That Account; And The Verses Which Had Been Publicly Read, Were, After Being Written In Gold Letters, Consecrated To Jupiter Capitolinus.</a> <span class="flex">692</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="695">Xii. These Games He Beheld From The Front Of The Proscenium. In The Show Of Gladiators, Which He Exhibited In A Wooden Amphitheatre, Built Within A Year In The District Of The Campus Martius , He Ordered That None Should Be Slain, Not Even The Condemned Criminals Employed In The Combats. He Secured Four Hundred Senators, And Six Hundred Roman Knights, Amongst Whom Were Some Of Unbroken Fortunes And Unblemished Reputation, To Act As Gladiators. From The Same Orders, He Engaged Persons To Encounter Wild Beasts, And For Various Other Services In The Theatre. He Presented The Public With The Representation Of A Naval Fight, Upon Sea-water, With Huge Fishes Swimming In It; As Also With The Pyrrhic Dance, Performed By Certain Youths, To Each Of Whom, After The Performance Was Over, He Granted The Freedom Of Rome. During This Diversion, A Bull Covered Pasiphae, Concealed Within A Wooden Statue Of A Cow, As Many Of The Spectators Believed. Icarus, Upon His First Attempt To Fly, Fell On The Stage Close To  Wrestlers Perform, Because, At Olympia, The Priestesses Of Ceres Are Allowed The Privilege Of Witnessing That Exhibition.</a> <span class="flex">695</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="696">Xiii. Amongst The Spectacles Presented By Him, The Solemn Entrance Of Tiridates  Into The City Deserves To Be Mentioned. This Personage, Who Was King Of Armenia, He Invited To Rome By Very Liberal Promises. But Being Prevented By Unfavourable Weather From Showing Him To The People Upon The Day Fixed By Proclamation, He Took The First Opportunity Which Occurred; Several Cohorts Being Drawn Up Under Arms, About The Temples In The Forum, While He Was Seated On A Curule Chair On The Rostra, In A Triumphal Dress, Amidst The Military Standards And Ensigns. Upon Tiridates Advancing Towards Him, On A Stage Made Shelving For The Purpose, He Permitted Him To Throw Himself At His Feet, But Quickly Raised Him With His Right Hand, And Kissed Him. The Emperor Then, At The King’s Request, Took The Turban From His Head, And Replaced It By A Crown, Whilst A Person Of Pretorian Rank Proclaimed In Latin The Words In Which The Prince Addressed The Emperor As A Suppliant. After This Ceremony, The King Was Conducted To The Theatre, Where, After Renewing His Obeisance, Nero Seated Him On His Right Hand. Being Then Greeted By Universal Acclamation With The Title Of Emperor, And Sending His Laurel Crown To The Capitol, Nero Shut The Temple Of The Two-faced Janus, As Though There Now Existed No War Throughout The Roman Empire.</a> <span class="flex">696</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="697">Xiv. He Filled The Consulship Four Times : The First For Two Months, The Second And Last For Six, And The Third For Four; The Two Intermediate Ones He Held Successively, But The Others After An Interval Of Some Years Between Them.</a> <span class="flex">697</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="698">Xv. In The Administration Of Justice, He Scarcely Ever Gave His Decision On The Pleadings Before The Next Day, And Then In Writing. His Manner Of Hearing Causes Was Not To Allow Any Adjournment, But To Dispatch Them In Order As They Stood. When He Withdrew To Consult His Assessors, He Did Not Debate The Matter Openly With Them; But Silently And Privately Reading Over Their Opinions, Which They Gave Separately In Writing,  He Pronounced Sentence From The Tribunal According To His Own View Of The Case, As If It Was The Opinion Of The Majority. For A Long Time He Would Not Admit The Sons Of Freedmen Into The Senate; And Those Who Had Been Admitted By Former Princes, He Excluded From All Public Offices. To Supernumerary Candidates He Gave Command In The Legions, To Comfort Them Under The Delay Of Their Hopes. The Consulship He Commonly Conferred For Six Months; And One Of The Two Consuls Dying A Little Before The First Of January, He Substituted No One In His Place; Disliking What Had Been Formerly Done For Caninius Rebilus On Such An Occasion, Who Was Consul For One Day Only. He Allowed The Triumphal Honours Only To Those Who Were Of Quaestorian Rank, And To Some Of The Equestrian Order; And Bestowed Them Without Regard To Military Service. And Instead Of The Quaestors, Whose Office It Properly Was, He Frequently Ordered That The Addresses, Which He Sent To The Senate On Certain Occasions, Should Be Read By The Consuls.</a> <span class="flex">698</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="699">Xvi. He Devised A New Style Of Building In The City, Ordering Piazzas To Be Erected Before All Houses, Both In The Streets And Detached, To Give Facilities From Their Terraces, In Case Of Fire, For Preventing It From Spreading; And These He Built At His Own Expense. He Likewise Designed To Extend The City Walls As Far As Ostia, And Bring The Sea From Thence By A Canal Into The Old City. Many Severe Regulations And New Orders Were Made In His Time. A Sumptuary Law Was Enacted. Public Suppers Were Limited To The Sportulae ; And Victualling-houses Restrained From Selling Any Dressed Victuals, Except Pulse And Herbs, Whereas Before They Sold All Kinds Of Meat. He Likewise Inflicted Punishments On The Christians, A Sort Of People Who Held A New And Impious  Superstition.</a> <span class="flex">699</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="701">Xvii. To Prevent Forgery, A Method Was Then First Invented, Of Having Writings Bored, Run Through Three Times With A Thread, And Then Sealed. It Was Likewise Provided That In Wills, The Two First Pages, With Only The Testator’s Name Upon Them, Should Be Presented Blank To Those Who Were To Sign Them As Witnesses; And That No One Who Wrote A Will For Another, Should Insert Any Legacy For Himself. It Was Likewise Ordained That Clients Should Pay Their Advocates A Certain Reasonable Fee, But Nothing For The Court, Which Was To Be Gratuitous, The Charges For It Being Paid Out Of The Public Treasury; That Causes, The Cognizance Of Which Before Belonged To The Judges Of The Exchequer, Should Be Transferred To The Forum, And The Ordinary Tribunals; And That All Appeals From The Judges Should Be Made To The Senate.</a> <span class="flex">701</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="702">Xviii. He Never Entertained The Least Ambition Or Hope Of Augmenting And Extending The Frontiers Of The Empire. On The Contrary, He Had Thoughts Of Withdrawing The Troops From Britain, And Was Only Restrained From So Doing By The Fear Of Appearing To Detract From The Glory Of His Father . All  That He Did Was To Reduce The Kingdom Of Pontus, Which Was Ceded To Him By Polemon, And Also The Alps , Upon The Death Of Cottius, Into The Form Of A Province.</a> <span class="flex">702</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="703">Xix. Twice Only He Undertook Any Foreign Expeditions, One To Alexandria, And The Other To Achaia; But He Abandoned The Prosecution Of The Former On The Very Day Fixed For His Departure, By Being Deterred Both By Ill Omens, And The Hazard Of The Voyage. For While He Was Making The Circuit Of The Temples, Having Seated Himself In That Of Vesta, When He Attempted To Rise, The Skirt Of His Robe Stuck Fast; And He Was Instantly Seized With Such A Dimness In His Eyes, That He Could Not See A Yard Before Him. In Achaia, He Attempted To Make A Cut Through The Isthmus ; And, Having Made A Speech Encouraging His Pretorians To Set About The Work, On A Signal Given By Sound Of Trumpet, He First Broke Ground With A Spade, And Carried Off A Basket Full Of Earth Upon His Shoulders. He Made Preparations For An Expedition To The Pass Of The Caspian Mountains ; Forming A New Legion Out Of His Late Levies In Italy, Of Men All Six Feet High, Which He Called The Phalanx Of Alexander The Great. These Transactions, In Part Unexceptionable, And In Part Highly Commendable, I Have Brought Into One View, In Order To Separate Them From The Scandalous And Criminal Part Of His Conduct, Of Which I Shall Now Give An Account.</a> <span class="flex">703</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="704">Xx. Among The Other Liberal Arts Which He Was Taught In His Youth, He Was Instructed In Music; And Immediately After  Divided Into Several Parties, And Were Remarkable For Their Fine Heads Of Hair, And Were Extremely Well Dressed, With Rings Upon Their Left Hands. The Leaders Of These Bands Had Salaries Of Forty Thousand Sesterces Allowed Them.</a> <span class="flex">704</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="705">Xxi. At Rome Also, Being Extremely Proud Of His Singing, He Ordered The Games Called Neronia To Be Celebrated Before The Time Fixed For Their Return. All Now Becoming Importunate To Hear “His Heavenly Voice,” He Informed Them, “That He Would Gratify Those Who Desired It At The Gardens.” But The Soldiers Then On Guard Seconding The Voice Of The People, He Promised To Comply With Their Request Immediately, And With All His Heart. He Instantly Ordered His Name To Be Entered Upon The List Of Musicians Who Proposed To Contend, And Having Thrown His Lot Into The Urn Among The Rest, Took His Turn, And Entered, Attended By The Prefects Of The Pretorian Cohorts Bearing His Harp, And Followed By The Military Tribunes, And Several Of His Intimate Friends. After He Had Taken His Station, And Made The Usual Prelude, He Commanded Cluvius Rufus, A Man Of Consular Rank, To Proclaim In The Theatre, That He Intended To Sing The Story Of Niobe. This He Accordingly Did, And Continued It Until Nearly Ten O’clock, But Deferred The Disposal Of The Crown, And The Remaining Part Of The Solemnity, Until The Next Year; That He Might Have More Frequent Opportunities Of Performing. But That Being Too Long, He Could Not Refrain From Often Appearing As A Public Performer During The Interval. He Made No Scruple Of Exhibiting On The Stage, Even In The Spectacles Presented To The People By Private Persons, And Was Offered By One Of The Praetors, No Less Than A Million Of Sesterces For His Services. He Likewise Sang Tragedies In A Mask; The Visors Of The Heroes And Gods, As Also Of The Heroines And Goddesses, Being Formed Into A Resemblance Of His Own Face, And That Of Any Woman He Was In Love With. Amongst The Rest, He Sung “Canace In Labour,”  “Orestes The Murderer Of His Mother,” “Oedipus  Blinded,” And “Hercules Mad.” In The Last Tragedy, It Is Said That A Young Sentinel, Posted At The Entrance Of The Stage, Seeing Him In A Prison Dress And Bound With Fetters, As The Fable Of The Play Required, Ran To His Assistance.</a> <span class="flex">705</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="706">Xxii. He Had From His Childhood An Extravagant Passion For Horses; And His Constant Talk Was Of The Circensian Races, Notwithstanding It Was Prohibited Him. Lamenting Once, Among His Fellow-pupils, The Case Of A Charioteer Of The Green Party, Who Was Dragged Round The Circus At The Tail Of His Chariot, And Being Reprimanded By His Tutor For It, He Pretended That He Was Talking Of Hector. In The Beginning Of His Reign, He Used To Amuse Himself Daily With Chariots Drawn By Four Horses, Made Of Ivory, Upon A Table. He Attended At All The Lesser Exhibitions In The Circus, At First Privately, But At Last Openly; So That Nobody Ever Doubted Of His Presence On Any Particular Day. Nor Did He Conceal His Desire To Have The Number Of The Prizes Doubled; So That The Races Being Increased Accordingly, The Diversion Continued Until A Late Hour; The Leaders Of Parties Refusing Now To Bring Out Their Companies For Any Time Less Than The Whole Day. Upon This, He Took A Fancy For Driving The Chariot Himself, And That Even Publicly. Having Made His First Experiment In The Gardens, Amidst Crowds Of Slaves And Other Rabble, He At Length Performed In The View Of All The People, In The Circus Maximus, Whilst One Of His Freedmen Dropped The Napkin In The Place Where The Magistrates Used To Give The Signal. Not Satisfied With Exhibiting Various Specimens Of His Skill In Those Arts At Rome, He Went Over To Achaia, As Has Been Already Said, Principally For This Purpose. The Several Cities, In Which Solemn Trials Of Musical Skill Used To Be Publicly Held, Had Resolved To Send Him The Crowns Belonging To Those Who Bore Away The Prize. These He Accepted So Graciously, That He Not Only Gave The Deputies Who Brought Them An Immediate Audience, But Even Invited Them To His Table. Being Requested By Some Of Them To Sing At Supper, And Prodigiously Applauded, He Said, “The Greeks Were The Only People Who Has An Ear For Music, And Were The Only Good Judges Of Him And His Attainments.” Without Delay He Commenced His Journey, And On His Arrival At Cassiope ,  Exhibited His First Musical Performance Before The Altar Of Jupiter Cassius.</a> <span class="flex">706</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="707">Xxiii. He Afterwards Appeared At The Celebration Of All Public Games In Greece: For Such As Fell In Different Years, He Brought Within The Compass Of One, And Some He Ordered To Be Celebrated A Second Time In The Same Year. At Olympia, Likewise, Contrary To Custom, He Appointed A Public Performance In Music: And That He Might Meet With No Interruption In This Employment, When He Was Informed By His Freedman Helius, That Affairs At Rome Required His Presence, He Wrote To Him In These Words: “Though Now All Your Hopes And Wishes Are For My Speedy Return, Yet You Ought Rather To Advise And Hope That I May Come Back With A Character Worthy Of Nero.” During The Time Of His Musical Performance, Nobody Was Allowed To Stir Out Of The Theatre Upon Any Account, However Necessary; Insomuch, That It Is Said Some Women With Child Were Delivered There. Many Of The Spectators Being Quite Wearied With Hearing And Applauding Him, Because The Town Gates Were Shut, Slipped Privately Over The Walls; Or Counterfeiting Themselves Dead, Were Carried Out For Their Funeral. With What Extreme Anxiety He Engaged In These Contests, With What Keen Desire To Bear Away The Prize, And With How Much Awe Of The Judges, Is Scarcely To Be Believed. As If His Adversaries Had Been On A Level With Himself, He Would Watch Them Narrowly, Defame Them Privately, And Sometimes, Upon Meeting Them, Rail At Them In Very Scurrilous Language; Or Bribe Them, If They Were Better Performers Than Himself. He Always Addressed The Judges With The Most Profound Reverence Before He Began, Telling Them, “He Had Done All Things That Were Necessary, By Way Of Preparation, But That The Issue Of The Approaching Trial Was In The Hand Of Fortune; And That They, As Wise And Skilful Men, Ought To Exclude From Their Judgment Things Merely Accidental.” Upon Their Encouraging Him To Have A Good Heart, He Went Off With More Assurance, But Not Entirely Free From Anxiety; Interpreting The Silence And Modesty Of Some Of Them Into Sourness And Ill-nature, And Saying That He Was Suspicious Of Them.</a> <span class="flex">707</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="708">Xxiv. In These Contests, He Adhered So Strictly To The Rules,  That He Never Durst Spit, Nor Wipe The Sweat From His Forehead In Any Other Way Than With His Sleeve. Having, In The Performance Of A Tragedy, Dropped His Sceptre, And Not Quickly Recovering It, He Was In A Great Fright, Lest He Should Be Set Aside For The Miscarriage, And Could Not Regain His Assurance, Until An Actor Who Stood By Swore He Was Certain It Had Not Been Observed In The Midst Of The Acclamations And Exultations Of The People. When The Prize Was Adjudged To Him, He Always Proclaimed It Himself; And Even Entered The Lists With The Heralds. That No Memory Or The Least Monument Might Remain Of Any Other Victor In The Sacred Grecian Games, He Ordered All Their Statues And Pictures To Be Pulled Down, Dragged Away With Hooks, And Thrown Into The Common Sewers. He Drove The Chariot With Various Numbers Of Horses, And At The Olympic Games With No Fewer Than Ten; Though, In A Poem Of His, He Had Reflected Upon Mithridates For That Innovation. Being Thrown Out Of His Chariot, He Was Again Replaced, But Could Not Retain His Seat, And Was Obliged To Give Up, Before He Reached The Goal, But Was Crowned Notwithstanding. On His Departure, He Declared The Whole Province A Free Country, And Conferred Upon The Judges In The Several Games The Freedom Of Rome, With Large Sums Of Money. All These Favours He Proclaimed Himself With His Own Voice, From The Middle Of The Stadium, During The Solemnity Of The Isthmian Games.</a> <span class="flex">708</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="709">Xxv. On His Return From Greece, Arriving At Naples, Because He Had Commenced His Career As A Public Performer In That City, He Made His Entrance In A Chariot Drawn By White Horses Through A Breach In The City-wall, According To The Practice Of Those Who Were Victorious In The Sacred Grecian Games. In The Same Manner He Entered Antium, Alba, And Rome. He Made His Entry Into The City Riding In The Same Chariot In Which Augustus Had Triumphed, In A Purple Tunic, And A Cloak Embroidered With Golden Stars, Having On His Head The Crown Won At Olympia, And In His Right Hand That Which Was Given Him At The Parthian Games: The Rest Being Carried In A Procession Before Him, With Inscriptions Denoting The Places Where They Had Been Won, From Whom, And In What Plays Or Musical Performances; Whilst A Train Followed Him With Loud Acclamations, Crying Out, That “They  Open Enmity To Many, According As They Were Lavish Or Sparing In Giving Him Their Applause.</a> <span class="flex">709</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="710">Xxvi. Petulancy, Lewdness, Luxury, Avarice, And Cruelty, He Practised At First With Reserve And In Private, As If Prompted To Them Only By The Folly Of Youth; But, Even Then, The World Was Of Opinion That They Were The Faults Of His Nature, And Not Of His Age. After It Was Dark, He Used To Enter The Taverns Disguised In A Cap Or A Wig, And Ramble About The Streets In Sport, Which Was Not Void Of Mischief. He Used To Beat Those He Met Coming Home From Supper; And, If They Made Any Resistance, Would Wound Them, And Throw Them Into The Common Sewer. He Broke Open And Robbed Shops; Establishing An Auction At Home For Selling His Booty. In The Scuffles Which Took Place On Those Occasions, He Often Ran The Hazard Of Losing His Eyes, And Even His Life; Being Beaten Almost To Death By A Senator, For Handling His Wife Indecently. After This Adventure, He Never Again Ventured Abroad At That Time Of Night, Without Some Tribunes Following Him At A Little Distance. In The Day-time He Would Be Carried To The Theatre Incognito In A Litter, Placing Himself Upon The Upper Part Of The Proscenium, Where He Not Only Witnessed The Quarrels Which Arose On Account Of The Performances, But Also Encouraged Them. When They Came To Blows, And Stones And Pieces Of Broken Benches Began To Fly About, He Threw Them Plentifully Amongst The People, And Once Even Broke A Praetor’s Head.</a> <span class="flex">710</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="711">Xxvii. His Vices Gaining Strength By Degrees, He Laid Aside His Jocular Amusements, And All Disguise; Breaking Out Into Enormous Crimes, Without The Least Attempt To Conceal Them. His Revels Were Prolonged From Mid-day To Midnight, While He Was Frequently Refreshed By Warm Baths, And, In The Summer Time, By Such As Were Cooled With Snow. He Often Supped In Public, In The Naumachia, With The Sluices Shut, Or In The Campus Martius, Or The Circus Maximus, Being Waited Upon At Table By Common Prostitutes Of The Town, And Syrian Strumpets And Glee-girls. As Often As He Went Down The Tiber To Ostia, Or Coasted Through The Gulf Of Baiae, Booths Furnished As Brothels And Eating-houses, Were Erected Along The Shore And River Banks; Before Which Stood Matrons, Who, Like Bawds And Hostesses, Allured Him To Land. It Was Also His Custom To Invite  Himself To Supper With His Friends; At One Of Which Was Expended No Less Than Four Millions Of Sesterces In Chaplets, And At Another Something More In Roses.</a> <span class="flex">711</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="712">Xxviii. Besides The Abuse Of Free-born Lads, And The Debauch Of Married Women, He Committed A Rape Upon Rubria, A Vestal Virgin. He Was Upon The Point Of Marrying Acte , His Freedwoman, Having Suborned Some Men Of Consular Rank To Swear That She Was Of Royal Descent. He Gelded The Boy Sporus, And Endeavoured To Transform Him Into A Woman. He Even Went So Far As To Marry Him, With All The Usual Formalities Of A Marriage Settlement, The Rose-coloured Nuptial Veil, And A Numerous Company At The Wedding. When The Ceremony Was Over, He Had Him Conducted Like A Bride To His Own House, And Treated Him As His Wife . It Was Jocularly Observed By Some Person, “That It Would Have Been Well For Mankind, Had Such A Wife Fallen To The Lot Of His Father Domitius.” This Sporus He Carried About With Him In A Litter Round The Solemn Assemblies And Fairs Of Greece, And Afterwards At Rome Through The Sigillaria , Dressed In The Rich Attire Of An Empress; Kissing Him From Time To Time As They Rode Together. That He Entertained An Incestuous Passion For His Mother , But Was Deterred By Her Enemies, For Fear That This Haughty And Overbearing Woman Should, By Her Compliance, Get Him Entirely Into Her Power, And Govern In Every Thing, Was Universally Believed; Especially After He Had Introduced Amongst His Concubines A Strumpet, Who Was Reported To Have A Strong Resemblance To Agrippina .————</a> <span class="flex">712</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="713">Xxix. He Prostituted His Own Chastity To Such A Degree, That  After He Had Defiled Every Part Of His Person With Some Unnatural Pollution, He At Last Invented An Extraordinary Kind Of Diversion; Which Was, To Be Let Out Of A Den In The Arena, Covered With The Skin Of A Wild Beast, And Then Assail With Violence The Private Parts Both Of Men And Women, While They Were Bound To Stakes. After He Had Vented His Furious Passion Upon Them, He Finished The Play In The Embraces Of His Freedman Doryphorus , To Whom He Was Married In The Same Way That Sporus Had Been Married To Himself; Imitating The Cries And Shrieks Of Young Virgins, When They Are Ravished. I Have Been Informed From Numerous Sources, That He Firmly Believed, No Man In The World To Be Chaste, Or Any Part Of His Person Undefiled; But That Most Men Concealed That Vice, And Were Cunning Enough To Keep It Secret. To Those, Therefore, Who Frankly Owned Their Unnatural Lewdness, He Forgave All Other Crimes.</a> <span class="flex">713</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="714">Xxx. He Thought There Was No Other Use Of Riches And Money Than To Squander Them Away Profusely; Regarding All Those As Sordid Wretches Who Kept Their Expenses Within Due Bounds; And Extolling Those As Truly Noble And Generous Souls, Who Lavished Away And Wasted All They Possessed. He Praised And Admired His Uncle Caius , Upon No Account More, Than For Squandering In A Short Time The Vast Treasure Left Him By Tiberius. Accordingly, He Was Himself Extravagant And Profuse, Beyond All Bounds. He Spent Upon Tiridates Eight Hundred Thousand Sesterces A Day, A Sum Almost Incredible; And At His Departure, Presented Him With Upwards Of A Million . He Likewise Bestowed Upon Menecrates The Harper, And Spicillus A Gladiator, The Estates And Houses Of Men Who Had Received The Honour Of A Triumph. He Enriched The Usurer Cercopithecus Panerotes With Estates Both In Town And Country; And Gave Him A Funeral, In Pomp And Magnificence Little Inferior To That Of Princes. He Never Wore The Same Garment Twice. He  Has Been Known To Stake Four Hundred Thousand Sesterces On A Throw Of The Dice. It Was His Custom To Fish With A Golden Net, Drawn By Silken Cords Of Purple And Scarlet. It Is Said, That He Never Travelled With Less Than A Thousand Baggage-carts; The Mules Being All Shod With Silver, And The Drivers Dressed In Scarlet Jackets Of The Finest Canusian Cloth , With A Numerous Train Of Footmen, And Troops Of Mazacans , With Bracelets On Their Arms, And Mounted Upon Horses In Splendid Trappings.</a> <span class="flex">714</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="715">Xxxi. In Nothing Was He More Prodigal Than In His Buildings. He Completed His Palace By Continuing It From The Palatine To The Esquiline Hill, Calling The Building At First Only “The Passage,” But, After It Was Burnt Down And Rebuilt, “The Golden House.”  Of Its Dimensions And Furniture, It May Be Sufficient To Say Thus Much: The Porch Was So High That There Stood In It A Colossal Statue Of Himself A Hundred And Twenty Feet In Height; And The Space Included In It Was So Ample, That It Had Triple Porticos A Mile In Length, And A Lake Like A Sea, Surrounded With Buildings Which Had The Appearance Of A City. Within Its Area Were Corn Fields, Vineyards, Pastures, And Woods, Containing A Vast Number Of Animals Of Various Kinds, Both Wild And Tame. In Other Parts It Was Entirely Over-laid With Gold, And Adorned With Jewels And Mother Of Pearl. The Supper Rooms Were Vaulted, And Compartments Of The Ceilings, Inlaid With Ivory, Were Made To Revolve, And Scatter Flowers; While They Contained Pipes Which  Shed Unguents Upon The Guests. The Chief Banqueting Room Was Circular, And Revolved Perpetually, Night And Day, In Imitation Of The Motion Of The Celestial Bodies. The Baths Were Supplied With Water From The Sea And The Albula. Upon The Dedication Of This Magnificent House After It Was Finished, All He Said In Approval Of It Was, “That He Had Now A Dwelling Fit For A Man.” He Commenced Making A Pond For The Reception Of All The Hot Streams From Baiae, Which He Designed To Have Continued From Misenum To The Avernian Lake, In A Conduit, Enclosed In Galleries; And Also A Canal From Avernum To Ostia, That Ships Might Pass From One To The Other, Without A Sea Voyage. The Length Of The Proposed Canal Was One Hundred And Sixty Miles; And It Was Intended To Be Of Breadth Sufficient To Permit Ships With Five Banks Of Oars To Pass Each Other. For The Execution Of These Designs, He Ordered All Prisoners, In Every Part Of The Empire, To Be Brought To Italy; And That Even Those Who Were Convicted Of The Most Heinous Crimes, In Lieu Of Any Other Sentence, Should Be Condemned To Work At Them. He Was Encouraged To All This Wild And Enormous Profusion, Not Only By The Great Revenue Of The Empire, But By The Sudden Hopes Given Him Of An Immense Hidden Treasure, Which Queen Dido, Upon Her Flight From Tyre, Had Brought With Her To Africa. This, A Roman Knight Pretended To Assure Him, Upon Good Grounds, Was Still Hid There In Some Deep Caverns, And Might With A Little Labour Be Recovered.</a> <span class="flex">715</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="716">Xxxii. But Being Disappointed In His Expectations Of This Resource, And Reduced To Such Difficulties, For Want Of Money, That He Was Obliged To Defer Paying His Troops, And The Rewards Due To The Veterans; He Resolved Upon Supplying His Necessities By Means Of False Accusations And Plunder. In The First Place, He Ordered, That If Any Freedman, Without Sufficient Reason, Bore The Name Of The Family To Which He Belonged; The Half, Instead Of Three Fourths, Of His Estate Should Be Brought Into The Exchequer At His Decease: Also That The Estates Of All Such Persons As Had Not In Their Wills Been Mindful Of Their Prince, Should Be Confiscated; And That The Lawyers Who Had Drawn Or Dictated Such Wills, Should Be Liable To A Fine. He Ordained Likewise, That All Words And Actions, Upon Which Any Informer Could Ground A Prosecution, Should Be Deemed Treason. He Demanded An Equivalent For The Crowns Which The Cities Of  Greece Had At Any Time Offered Him In The Solemn Games. Having Forbad Any One To Use The Colours Of Amethyst And Tyrian Purple, He Privately Sent A Person To Sell A Few Ounces Of Them Upon The Day Of The Nundinae, And Then Shut Up All The Merchants’ Shops, On The Pretext That His Edict Had Been Violated. It Is Said, That, As He Was Playing And Singing In The Theatre, Observing A Married Lady Dressed In The Purple Which He Had Prohibited, He Pointed Her Out To His Procurators; Upon Which She Was Immediately Dragged Out Of Her Seat, And Not Only Stripped Of Her Clothes, But Her Property. He Never Nominated A Person To Any Office Without Saying To Him, “You Know What I Want; And Let Us Take Care That Nobody Has Any Thing He Can Call His Own.” At Last He Rifled Many Temples Of The Rich Offerings With Which They Were Stored, And Melted Down All The Gold And Silver Statues, And Amongst Them Those Of The Penates , Which Galba Afterwards Restored.</a> <span class="flex">716</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="717">Xxxiii. He Began The Practice Of Parricide And Murder With Claudius Himself; For Although He Was Not The Contriver Of His Death, He Was Privy To The Plot. Nor Did He Make Any Secret Of It; But Used Afterwards To Commend, In A Greek Proverb, Mushrooms As Food Fit For The Gods, Because Claudius Had Been Poisoned With Them. He Traduced His Memory Both By Word And Deed In The Grossest Manner; One While Charging Him With Folly, Another While With Cruelty. For He Used To Say By Way Of Jest, That He Had Ceased Morari  Amongst Men, Pronouncing The First Syllable Long; And Treated As Null Many Of His Decrees And Ordinances, As Made By A Doting Old Blockhead. He Enclosed The Place Where His Body Was Burnt With Only A Low Wall Of Rough Masonry. He Attempted To Poison  Britannicus, As Much Out Of Envy Because He Had A Sweeter Voice, As From Apprehension Of What Might Ensue From The Respect Which The People Entertained For His Father’s Memory. He Employed For This Purpose A Woman Named Locusta, Who Had Been A Witness Against Some Persons Guilty Of Like Practices. But The Poison She Gave Him, Working More Slowly Than He Expected, And Only Causing A Purge, He Sent For The Woman, And Beat Her With His Own Hand, Charging Her With Administering An Antidote Instead Of Poison; And Upon Her Alleging In Excuse, That She Had Given Britannicus But A Gentle Mixture In Order To Prevent Suspicion, “Think You,” Said He, “That I Am Afraid Of The Julian Law;” And Obliged Her To Prepare, In His Own Chamber And Before His Eyes, As Quick And Strong A Dose As Possible. This He Tried Upon A Kid: But The Animal Lingering For Five Hours Before It Expired, He Ordered Her To Go To Work Again; And When She Had Done, He Gave The Poison To A Pig, Which Dying Immediately, He Commanded The Potion To Be Brought Into The Eating-room And Given To Britannicus, While He Was At Supper With Him. The Prince Had No Sooner Tasted It Than He Sunk On The Floor, Nero Meanwhile, Pretending To The Guests, That It Was Only A Fit Of The Falling Sickness, To Which, He Said, He Was Subject. He Buried Him The Following Day, In A Mean And Hurried Way, During Violent Storms Of Rain. He Gave Locusta A Pardon, And Rewarded Her With A Great Estate In Land, Placing Some Disciples With Her, To Be Instructed In Her Trade.</a> <span class="flex">717</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="718">Xxxiv. His Mother Being Used To Make Strict Inquiry Into What He Said Or Did, And To Reprimand Him With The Freedom Of A Parent, He Was So Much Offended, That He Endeavoured To Expose Her To Public Resentment, By Frequently Pretending A Resolution To Quit The Government, And Retire To Rhodes. Soon Afterwards, He Deprived Her Of All Honour And Power, Took From Her The Guard Of Roman And German Soldiers, Banished Her From The Palace And From His Society, And Persecuted Her In Every Way He Could Contrive; Employing Persons To Harass Her When At Rome With Law-suits, And To Disturb Her In Her Retirement From Town With The Most Scurrilous And Abusive Language, Following Her About By Land And Sea. But Being Terrified With Her Menaces And Violent Spirit, He Resolved Upon Her Destruction, And Thrice Attempted It By Poison. Finding, However,  And Burning Torches Of The Furies. Nay, He Attempted By Magical Rites To Bring Up Her Ghost From Below, And Soften Her Rage Against Him. When He Was In Greece, He Durst Not Attend The Celebration Of The Eleusinian Mysteries, At The Initiation Of Which, Impious And Wicked Persons Are Warned By The Voice Of The Herald From Approaching The Rites . Besides The Murder Of His Mother, He Had Been Guilty Of That Of His Aunt; For, Being Obliged To Keep Her Bed In Consequence Of A Complaint In Her Bowels, He Paid Her A Visit, And She, Being Then Advanced In Years, Stroking His Downy Chin, In The Tenderness Of Affection, Said To Him: “May I But Live To See The Day When This Is Shaved For The First Time , And I Shall Then Die Contented.” He Turned, However, To Those About Him, Made A Jest Of It, Saying, That He Would Have His Beard Immediately Taken Off, And Ordered The Physicians To Give Her More Violent Purgatives. He Seized Upon Her Estate Before She Had Expired; Suppressing Her Will, That He Might Enjoy The Whole Himself.</a> <span class="flex">718</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="719">Xxxv. He Had, Besides Octavia, Two Other Wives: Poppaea Sabina, Whose Father Had Borne The Office Of Quaestor, And Who Had Been Married Before To A Roman Knight: And, After Her, Statilia Messalina, Great-grand-daughter Of Taurus  Who Was Twice Consul, And Received The Honour Of A Triumph. To Obtain Possession Of Her, He Put To Death Her Husband, Atticus Vestinus, Who Was Then Consul. He Soon Became Disgusted With Octavia, And Ceased From Having Any Intercourse With Her; And Being Censured By His Friends For It, He Replied, “She Ought To Be Satisfied With Having The Rank And Appendages Of His Wife.” Soon Afterwards, He Made Several Attempts, But In Vain, To Strangle Her, And Then Divorced Her For Barrenness. But The People, Disapproving Of The Divorce, And Making Severe Comments Upon It, He Also Banished Her . At Last He  His Adoption, But Were Also Instrumental To His Advancement To The Empire, And Had Been His Governors, He Took Off By Poison Given Them In Their Meat Or Drink.</a> <span class="flex">719</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="720">Xxxvi. Nor Did He Proceed With Less Cruelty Against Those Who Were Not Of His Family. A Blazing Star, Which Is Vulgarly Supposed To Portend Destruction To Kings And Princes, Appeared Above The Horizon Several Nights Successively . He Felt Great Anxiety On Account Of This Phenomenon, And Being Informed By One Babilus, An Astrologer, That Princes Were Used To Expiate Such Omens By The Sacrifice Of Illustrious Persons, And So Avert The Danger Foreboded To Their Own Persons, By Bringing It On The Heads Of Their Chief Men, He Resolved On The Destruction Of The Principal Nobility In Rome. He Was The More Encouraged To This, Because He Had Some Plausible Pretence For Carrying It Into Execution, From The Discovery Of Two Conspiracies Against Him; The Former And More Dangerous Of Which Was That Formed By Piso , And Discovered At Rome; The Other Was That Of Vinicius , At Beneventum. The Conspirators Were Brought To Their Trials Loaded With Triple Fetters. Some Ingenuously Confessed The Charge; Others Avowed That They Thought The Design Against His Life An Act Of Favour For Which He Was Obliged To Them, As It Was Impossible In Any Other Way Than By Death To Relieve A Person Rendered Infamous By Crimes Of The Greatest Enormity. The Children Of Those Who Had Been Condemned, Were Banished The City, And Afterwards Either Poisoned Or Starved To Death. It Is Asserted That Some Of Them, With Their Tutors, And The Slaves Who Carried Their Satchels, Were All Poisoned Together At One Dinner; And Others Not Suffered To Seek Their Daily Bread.</a> <span class="flex">720</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="721">Xxxvii. From This Period He Butchered, Without Distinction Or Quarter, All Whom His Caprice Suggested As Objects For His Cruelty; And Upon The Most Frivolous Pretences. To Mention Only A Few: Salvidienus Orfitus Was Accused Of Letting  Out Three Taverns Attached To His House In The Forum To Some Cities For The Use Of Their Deputies At Rome. The Charge Against Cassius Longinus, A Lawyer Who Had Lost His Sight, Was, That He Kept Amongst The Busts Of His Ancestors That Of Caius Cassius, Who Was Concerned In The Death Of Julius Caesar. The Only Charge Objected Against Paetus Thrasea Was, That He Had A Melancholy Cast Of Features, And Looked Like A Schoolmaster. He Allowed But One Hour To Those Whom He Obliged To Kill Themselves; And, To Prevent Delay, He Sent Them Physicians “To Cure Them Immediately, If They Lingered Beyond That Time;” For So He Called Bleeding Them To Death. There Was At That Time An Egyptian Of A Most Voracious Appetite, Who Would Digest Raw Flesh, Or Any Thing Else That Was Given Him. It Was Credibly Reported, That The Emperor Was Extremely Desirous Of Furnishing Him With Living Men To Tear And Devour. Being Elated With His Great Success In The Perpetration Of Crimes, He Declared, “That No Prince Before Himself Ever Knew The Extent Of His Power.” He Threw Out Strong Intimations That He Would Not Even Spare The Senators Who Survived, But Would Entirely Extirpate That Order, And Put The Provinces And Armies Into The Hands Of The Roman Knights And His Own Freedmen. It Is Certain That He Never Gave Or Vouchsafed To Allow Any One The Customary Kiss, Either On Entering Or Departing, Or Even Returned A Salute. And At The Inauguration Of A Work, The Cut Through The Isthmus , He, With A Loud Voice, Amidst The Assembled Multitude, Uttered A Prayer, That “The Undertaking Might Prove Fortunate For Himself And The Roman People,” Without Taking The Smallest Notice Of The Senate.</a> <span class="flex">721</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="722">Xxxviii.

To These Terrible And Shameful Calamities Brought Upon The People By Their Prince, Were Added Some Proceeding From Misfortune. Such Were A Pestilence, By Which, Within The Space Of One Autumn, There Died No Less Than Thirty Thousand Persons, As Appeared From The Registers In The Temple Of Libitina; A Great Disaster In Britain , Where Two Of The Principal Towns Belonging To The Romans Were Plundered; And A  Dreadful Havoc Made Both Amongst Our Troops And Allies; A Shameful Discomfiture Of The Army Of The East; Where, In Armenia, The Legions Were Obliged To Pass Under The Yoke, And It Was With Great Difficulty That Syria Was Retained. Amidst All These Disasters, It Was Strange, And, Indeed, Particularly Remarkable, That He Bore Nothing More Patiently Than The Scurrilous Language And Railing Abuse Which Was In Every One’s Mouth; Treating No Class Of Persons With More Gentleness, Than Those Who Assailed Him With Invective And Lampoons. Many Things Of That Kind Were Posted Up About The City, Or Otherwise Published, Both In Greek And Latin: Such As These,</a> <span class="flex">725</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="729">Xl. The World, After Tolerating Such An Emperor For Little Less Than Fourteen Years, At Length Forsook Him; The Gauls, Headed By Julius Vindex, Who At That Time Governed The Province As Pro-praetor, Being The First To Revolt. Nero Had Been Formerly Told By Astrologers, That It Would Be His Fortune To Be At Last Deserted By All The World; And This Occasioned That Celebrated Saying Of His, “An Artist Can Live In Any Country;” By Which He Meant To Offer As An Excuse For His Practice Of Music, That It Was Not Only His Amusement As A Prince, But Might Be His Support When Reduced To A Private Station. Yet Some Of The Astrologers Promised Him, In His Forlorn State, The Rule Of The East, And Some In Express Words The Kingdom Of Jerusalem. But The Greater Part Of Them Flattered Him With Assurances Of His Being Restored To His Former Fortune. And Being Most Inclined To Believe The Latter Prediction, Upon Losing Britain And Armenia, He Imagined He Had Run Through All The Misfortunes Which The Fates Had Decreed Him. But When, Upon Consulting The Oracle Of Apollo At Delphi, He Was Advised To Beware Of The Seventy-third Year, As If He Were Not To Die Till Then, Never Thinking Of Galba’s Age, He Conceived Such Hopes, Not Only Of Living To Advanced Years, But Of Constant And Singular Good Fortune, That Having Lost Some Things Of Great Value By Shipwreck, He Scrupled Not To Say Amongst His Friends, That  “The Fishes Would Bring Them Back To Him.” At Naples He Heard Of The Insurrection In Gaul, On The Anniversary Of The Day On Which He Killed His Mother, And Bore It With So Much Unconcern, As To Excite A Suspicion That He Was Really Glad Of It, Since He Had Now A Fair Opportunity Of Plundering Those Wealthy Provinces By The Right Of War. Immediately Going To The Gymnasium, He Witnessed The Exercise Of The Wrestlers With The Greatest Delight. Being Interrupted At Supper With Letters Which Brought Yet Worse News, He Expressed No Greater Resentment, Than Only To Threaten The Rebels. For Eight Days Together, He Never Attempted To Answer Any Letters, Nor Give Any Orders, But Buried The Whole Affair In Profound Silence.</a> <span class="flex">729</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="730">Xli. Being Roused At Last By Numerous Proclamations Of Vindex, Treating Him With Reproaches And Contempt, He In A Letter To The Senate Exhorted Them To Avenge His Wrongs And Those Of The Republic; Desiring Them To Excuse His Not Appearing In The Senate-house, Because He Had Got Cold. But Nothing So Much Galled Him, As To Find Himself Railed At As A Pitiful Harper, And, Instead Of Nero, Styled Aenobarbus: Which Being His Family Name, Since He Was Upbraided With It, He Declared That He Would Resume It, And Lay Aside The Name He Had Taken By Adoption. Passing By The Other Accusations As Wholly Groundless, He Earnestly Refuted That Of His Want Of Skill In An Art Upon Which He Had Bestowed So Much Pains, And In Which He Had Arrived At Such Perfection; Asking Frequently Those About Him, “If They Knew Any One Who Was A More Accomplished Musician?” But Being Alarmed By Messengers After Messengers Of Ill News From Gaul, He Returned In Great Consternation To Rome. On The Road, His Mind Was Somewhat Relieved, By Observing The Frivolous Omen Of A Gaulish Soldier Defeated And Dragged By The Hair By A Roman Knight, Which Was Sculptured On A Monument; So That He Leaped For Joy, And Adored The Heavens. Even Then He Made No Appeal Either To The Senate Or People, But Calling Together Some Of The Leading Men At His Own House, He Held A Hasty Consultation Upon The Present State Of Affairs, And Then, During The Remainder Of The Day, Carried Them About With Him To View Some Musical Instruments, Of A New Invention, Which Were Played By Water   Exhibiting All The Parts, And Discoursing Upon The Principles And Difficulties Of The Contrivance; Which, He Told Them, He Intended To Produce In The Theatre, If Vindex Would Give Him Leave.</a> <span class="flex">730</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="731">Xlii. Soon Afterwards, He Received Intelligence That Galba And The Spaniards Had Declared Against Him; Upon Which, He Fainted, And Losing His Reason, Lay A Long Time Speechless, Apparently Dead. As Soon As Recovered From This State Stupefaction He Tore His Clothes, And Beat His Head, Crying Out, “It Is All Over With Me!” His Nurse Endeavouring To Comfort Him, And Telling Him That The Like Things Had Happened To Other Princes Before Him, He Replied, “I Am Beyond All Example Wretched, For I Have Lost An Empire Whilst I Am Still Living.” He, Nevertheless, Abated Nothing Of His Luxury And Inattention To Business. Nay, On The Arrival Of Good News From The Provinces, He, At A Sumptuous Entertainment, Sung With An Air Of Merriment, Some Jovial Verses Upon The Leaders Of The Revolt, Which Were Made Public; And Accompanied Them With Suitable Gestures. Being Carried Privately To The Theatre, He Sent Word To An Actor Who Was Applauded By The Spectators, “That He Had It All His Own Way, Now That He Himself Did Not Appear On The Stage.”</a> <span class="flex">731</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="732">Xliii. At The First Breaking Out Of These Troubles, It Is Believed That He Had Formed Many Designs Of A Monstrous Nature, Although Conformable Enough To His Natural Disposition. These Were To Send New Governors And Commanders To The Provinces And The Armies, And Employ Assassins To Butcher All The Former Governors And Commanders, As Men Unanimously Engaged In A Conspiracy Against Him; To Massacre The Exiles In Every Quarter, And All The Gaulish Population In Rome; The Former Lest They Should Join The Insurrection; The Latter As Privy To The Designs Of Their Countrymen, And Ready To Support  Them; To Abandon Gaul Itself, To Be Wasted And Plundered By His Armies; To Poison The Whole Senate At A Feast; To Fire The City, And Then Let Loose The Wild Beasts Upon The People, In Order To Impede Their Stopping The Progress Of The Flames. But Being Deterred From The Execution Of These Designs Not So Much By Remorse Of Conscience, As By Despair Of Being Able To Effect Them, And Judging An Expedition Into Gaul Necessary, He Removed The Consuls From Their Office, Before The Time Of Its Expiration Was Arrived; And In Their Room Assumed The Consulship Himself Without A Colleague, As If The Fates Had Decreed That Gaul Should Not Be Conquered, But By A Consul. Upon Assuming The Fasces, After An Entertainment At The Palace, As He Walked Out Of The Room Leaning On The Arms Of Some Of His Friends, He Declared, That As Soon As He Arrived In The Province, He Would Make His Appearance Amongst The Troops, Unarmed, And Do Nothing But Weep: And That, After He Had Brought The Mutineers To Repentance, He Would, The Next Day, In The Public Rejoicings, Sing Songs Of Triumph, Which He Must Now, Without Loss Of Time, Apply Himself To Compose.</a> <span class="flex">732</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="733">Xliv. In Preparing For This Expedition, His First Care Was To Provide Carriages For His Musical Instruments And Machinery To Be Used Upon The Stage; To Have The Hair Of The Concubines He Carried With Him Dressed In The Fashion Of Men; And To Supply Them With Battle-axes, And Amazonian Bucklers. He Summoned The City-tribes To Enlist; But No Qualified Persons Appearing, He Ordered All Masters To Send A Certain Number Of Slaves, The Best They Had, Not Excepting Their Stewards And Secretaries. He Commanded The Several Orders Of The People To Bring In A Fixed Proportion Of Their Estates, As They Stood In The Censor’s Books; All Tenants Of Houses And Mansions To Pay One Year’s Rent Forthwith Into The Exchequer; And, With Unheard-of Strictness, Would Receive Only New Coin Of The Purest Silver And The Finest Gold; Insomuch That Most People Refused To Pay, Crying Out Unanimously That He Ought To Squeeze The Informers, And Oblige Them To Surrender Their Gains.</a> <span class="flex">733</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="734">Xlv. The General Odium In Which He Was Held Received An Increase By The Great Scarcity Of Corn, And An Occurrence Connected With It. For, As It Happened Just At That Time, There Arrived From Alexandria A Ship, Which Was Said To Be Freighted  With Dust For The Wrestlers Belonging To The Emperor . This So Much Inflamed The Public Rage, That He Was Treated With The Utmost Abuse And Scurrility. Upon The Top Of One Of His Statues Was Placed The Figure Of A Chariot With A Greek Inscription, That “Now Indeed He Had A Race To Run; Let Him Be Gone.” A Little Bag Was Tied About Another, With A Ticket Containing These Words; “What Could I Do?”—“truly Thou Hast Merited The Sack.”  Some Person Likewise Wrote On The Pillars In The Forum, “That He Had Even Woke The Cocks  With His Singing.” And Many, In The Night-time, Pretending To Find Fault With Their Servants, Frequently Called For A Vindex.</a> <span class="flex">734</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="735">Xlvi. He Was Also Terrified With Manifest Warnings, Both Old And New, Arising From Dreams, Auspices, And Omens. He Had Never Been Used To Dream Before The Murder Of His Mother. After That Event, He Fancied In His Sleep That He Was Steering A Ship, And That The Rudder Was Forced From Him: That He Was Dragged By His Wife Octavia Into A Prodigiously Dark Place; And Was At One Time Covered Over With A Vast Swarm Of Winged Ants, And At Another, Surrounded By The National Images Which Were Set Up Near Pompey’s Theatre, And Hindered From Advancing Farther; That A Spanish Jennet He Was Fond Of, Had His Hinder Parts So Changed, As To Resemble Those Of An Ape; And Having His Head Only Left Unaltered, Neighed Very Harmoniously. The Doors Of The Mausoleum Of Augustus Flying Open Of Themselves, There Issued From It A Voice, Calling On Him By Name. The Lares Being Adorned With Fresh Garlands On The Calends  The Omens, Sporus Presented Him With A Ring, The Stone Of Which Had Carved Upon It The Rape Of Proserpine. When A Great Multitude Of The Several Orders Was Assembled, To Attend At The Solemnity Of Making Vows To The Gods, It Was A Long Time Before The Keys Of The Capitol Could Be Found. And When, In A Speech Of His To The Senate Against Vindex, These Words Were Read, “That The Miscreants Should Be Punished And Soon Make The End They Merited,” They All Cried Out, “You Will Do It, Augustus.” It Was Likewise Remarked, That The Last Tragic Piece Which He Sung, Was Oedipus In Exile, And That He Fell As He Was Repeating This Verse:</a> <span class="flex">735</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="737">Xlvii. Meanwhile, On The Arrival Of The News, That The Rest Of The Armies Had Declared Against Him, He Tore To Pieces The Letters Which Were Delivered To Him At Dinner, Overthrew The Table, And Dashed With Violence Against The Ground Two Favourite Cups, Which He Called Homer’s, Because Some Of That Poet’s Verses Were Cut Upon Them. Then Taking From Locusta A Dose Of Poison, Which He Put Up In A Golden Box, He Went Into The Servilian Gardens, And Thence Dispatching A Trusty Freedman To Ostia, With Orders To Make Ready A Fleet, He Endeavoured To Prevail With Some Tribunes And Centurions Of The Pretorian Guards To Attend Him In His Flight; But Part Of Them Showing No Great Inclination To Comply, Others Absolutely Refusing, And One Of Them Crying Out Aloud,</a> <span class="flex">737</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="740">Xlviii. But This Furious Impulse Subsiding, He Wished For Some Place Of Privacy, Where He Might Collect His Thoughts; And His Freedman Phaon Offering Him His Country-house, Between The Salarian  And Nomentan  Roads, About Four Miles From The City, He Mounted A Horse, Barefoot As He Was, And In His Tunic, Only Slipping Over It An Old Soiled Cloak; With His Head Muffled Up, And An Handkerchief Before His Face, And Four Persons Only To Attend Him, Of Whom Sporus Was One. He Was Suddenly Struck With Horror By An Earthquake, And By A Flash Of Lightning Which Darted Full In His Face, And Heard From The Neighbouring Camp  The Shouts Of The Soldiers, Wishing His Destruction, And Prosperity To Galba. He Also Heard A Traveller They Met On The Road, Say, “They Are  In Pursuit Of Nero:” And Another Ask, “Is There Any News In The City About Nero?” Uncovering His Face When His Horse Was Started By The Scent Of A Carcase Which Lay In The Road, He Was Recognized And Saluted By An Old Soldier Who Had Been Discharged From The Guards. When They Came To The Lane Which Turned Up To The House, They Quitted Their Horses, And With Much Difficulty He Wound Among Bushes, And Briars, And Along A Track Through A Bed Of Rushes, Over Which They Spread Their Cloaks For Him To Walk On. Having Reached A Wall At The Back Of The Villa, Phaon Advised Him To Hide Himself Awhile In A Sand-pit; When He Replied, “I Will Not Go Under-ground Alive.” Staying There Some Little Time, While Preparations Were Made For Bringing Him Privately Into The Villa, He Took Up Some Water Out Of A Neighbouring Tank In His Hand, To Drink, Saying, “This Is Nero’s Distilled Water.”  Then His Cloak Having Been Torn By The Brambles, He Pulled Out The Thorns Which Stuck In It. At Last, Being Admitted, Creeping Upon His Hands And Knees, Through A Hole Made For Him In The Wall, He Lay Down In The First Closet He Came To, Upon A Miserable Pallet, With An Old Coverlet Thrown Over It; And Being Both Hungry And Thirsty, Though He Refused Some Coarse Bread That Was Brought Him, He Drank A Little Warm Water.</a> <span class="flex">740</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="741">Xlix. All Who Surrounded Him Now Pressing Him To Save Himself From The Indignities Which Were Ready To Befall Him, He Ordered A Pit To Be Sunk Before His Eyes, Of The Size Of His Body, And The Bottom To Be Covered With Pieces Of Marble Put Together, If Any Could Be Found About The House; And Water And Wood , To Be Got Ready For Immediate Use About His Corpse; Weeping At Every Thing That Was Done, And Frequently Saying, “What An Artist Is Now About To Perish!” Meanwhile, Letters Being Brought In By A Servant Belonging To Phaon, He Snatched Them Out Of His Hand, And There Read, “That He Had Been Declared An Enemy By The Senate, And That Search Was Making For Him, That He Might Be Punished According To The Ancient Custom Of The Romans.” He Then Inquired What Kind Of Punishment That Was; And Being Told, That The  Practice Was To Strip The Criminal Naked, And Scourge Him To Death, While His Neck Was Fastened Within A Forked Stake, He Was So Terrified That He Took Up Two Daggers Which He Had Brought With Him, And After Feeling The Points Of Both, Put Them Up Again, Saying, “The Fatal Hour Is Not Yet Come.” One While, He Begged Of Sporus To Begin To Wail And Lament; Another While, He Entreated That One Of Them Would Set Him An Example By Killing Himself; And Then Again, He Condemned His Own Want Of Resolution In These Words: “I Yet Live To My Shame And Disgrace: This Is Not Becoming For Nero: It Is Not Becoming. Thou Oughtest In Such Circumstances To Have A Good Heart: Come, Then: Courage, Man!”  The Horsemen Who Had Received Orders To Bring Him Away Alive, Were Now Approaching The House. As Soon As He Heard Them Coming, He Uttered With A Trembling Voice The Following Verse,</a> <span class="flex">741</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="744">L. The Expenses Of His Funeral Amounted To Two Hundred Thousand Sesterces; The Bed Upon Which His Body Was Carried To The Pile And Burnt, Being Covered With The White Robes, Interwoven With Gold, Which He Had Worn Upon The Calends Of January Preceding. His Nurses, Ecloge And Alexandra, With His Concubine Acte, Deposited His Remains In The Tomb Belonging  To The Family Of The Domitii, Which Stands Upon The Top Of The Hill Of The Gardens , And Is To Be Seen From The Campus Martius. In That Monument, A Coffin Of Porphyry, With An Altar Of Marble Of Luna Over It, Is Enclosed By A Wall Built Of Stone Brought From Thasos.</a> <span class="flex">744</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="745">Li. In Stature He Was A Little Below The Common Height; His Skin Was Foul And Spotted; His Hair Inclined To Yellow; His Features Were Agreeable, Rather Than Handsome; His Eyes Grey And Dull, His Neck Was Thick, His Belly Prominent, His Legs Very Slender, His Constitution Sound. For, Though Excessively Luxurious In His Mode Of Living, He Had, In The Course Of Fourteen Years, Only Three Fits Of Sickness; Which Were So Slight, That He Neither Forbore The Use Of Wine, Nor Made Any Alteration In His Usual Diet. In His Dress, And The Care Of His Person, He Was So Careless, That He Had His Hair Cut In Rings, One Above Another; And When In Achaia, He Let It Grow Long Behind; And He Generally Appeared In Public In The Loose Dress Which He Used At Table, With A Handkerchief About His Neck, And Without Either A Girdle Or Shoes.</a> <span class="flex">745</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="746">Lii. He Was Instructed, When A Boy, In The Rudiments Of Almost All The Liberal Sciences; But His Mother Diverted Him From The Study Of Philosophy, As Unsuited To One Destined To Be An Emperor; And His Preceptor, Seneca, Discouraged Him From Reading The Ancient Orators, That He Might Longer Secure His Devotion To Himself. Therefore, Having A Turn For Poetry,  He Composed Verses Both With Pleasure And Ease; Nor Did He, As Some Think, Publish Those Of Other Writers As His Own. Several Little Pocket-books And Loose Sheets Have Cone Into My Possession, Which Contain Some Well-known Verses In His Own Hand, And Written In Such A Manner, That It Was Very Evident, From The Blotting And Interlining, That They Had Not Been Transcribed From A Copy, Nor Dictated By Another, But Were Written By The Composer Of Them.</a> <span class="flex">746</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="747">Liii. He Had Likewise Great Taste For Drawing And Painting, As Well As For Moulding Statues In Plaster. But, Above All Things, He Most Eagerly Coveted Popularity, Being The Rival Of Every Man Who Obtained The Applause Of The People For Any Thing He Did. It Was The General Belief, That, After The Crowns He Won By His Performances On The Stage, He Would The Next Lustrum Have Taken His Place Among The Wrestlers At The Olympic Games. For He Was Continually Practising That Art; Nor Did He Witness The Gymnastic Games In Any Part Of Greece Otherwise Than Sitting Upon The Ground In The Stadium, As The Umpires Do. And If A Pair Of Wrestlers Happened To Break The Bounds, He Would With His Own Hands Drag Them Back Into The Centre Of The Circle. Because He Was Thought To Equal Apollo In Music, And The Sun In Chariot-driving, He Resolved Also To Imitate The Achievements Of Hercules. And They Say That A Lion Was Got Ready For Him To Kill, Either With A Club, Or With A Close Hug, In View Of The People In The Amphitheatre; Which He Was To Perform Naked.</a> <span class="flex">747</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="748">Liv. Towards The End Of His Life, He Publicly Vowed, That If His Power In The State Was Securely Re-established, He Would, In The Spectacles Which He Intended To Exhibit In Honour Of His Success, Include A Performance Upon Organs , As Well As Upon Flutes And Bagpipes, And, On The Last Day Of The Games, Would Act In The Play, And Take The Part Of Turnus, As We Find It In Virgil. And There Are Some Who Say, That He Put To Death The Player Paris As A Dangerous Rival.</a> <span class="flex">748</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="749">Lv. He Had An Insatiable Desire To Immortalize His Name, And Acquire A Reputation Which Should Last Through All Succeeding Ages; But It Was Capriciously Directed. He Therefore  Took From Several Things And Places Their Former Appellations, And Gave Them New Names Derived From His Own. He Called The Month Of April, Neroneus, And Designed Changing The Name Of Rome Into That Of Neropolis.</a> <span class="flex">749</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="750">Lvi. He Held All Religious Rites In Contempt, Except Those Of The Syrian Goddess ; But At Last He Paid Her So Little Reverence, That He Made Water Upon Her; Being Now Engaged In Another Superstition, In Which Only He Obstinately Persisted. For Having Received From Some Obscure Plebeian A Little Image Of A Girl, As A Preservative Against Plots, And Discovering A Conspiracy Immediately After, He Constantly Worshipped His Imaginary Protectress As The Greatest Amongst The Gods, Offering To Her Three Sacrifices Daily. He Was Also Desirous To Have It Supposed That He Had, By Revelations From This Deity, A Knowledge Of Future Events. A Few Months Before He Died, He Attended A Sacrifice, According To The Etruscan Rites, But The Omens Were Not Favourable.</a> <span class="flex">750</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="751">Lvii. He Died In The Thirty-second Year Of His Age , Upon The Same Day On Which He Had Formerly Put Octavia To Death; And The Public Joy Was So Great Upon The Occasion, That The Common People Ran About The City With Caps Upon Their Heads. Some, However, Were Not Wanting, Who For A Long Time Decked His Tomb With Spring And Summer Flowers. Sometimes They Placed His Image Upon The Rostra, Dressed In Robes Of State; At Another, They Published Proclamations In His Name, As If He Were Still Alive, And Would Shortly Return To Rome, And Take Vengeance On All His Enemies. Vologesus, King Of The Parthians, When He Sent Ambassadors To The Senate To Renew His Alliance With The Roman People, Earnestly Requested That Due Honour Should Be Paid To The Memory Of Nero; And, To Conclude, When, Twenty Years Afterwards, At Which Time I Was A Young Man , Some Person Of Obscure Birth Gave Himself Out For Nero, That Name Secured Him So Favourable A Reception  From The Parthians, That He Was Very Zealously Supported, And It Was With Much Difficulty That They Were Prevailed Upon To Give Him Up.</a> <span class="flex">751</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="799">Sergius Sulpicius Galba.</a> <span class="flex">799</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="800">I. The Race Of The Caesars Became Extinct In Nero; An Event Prognosticated By Various Signs, Two Of Which Were Particularly Significant. Formerly, When Livia, After Her Marriage With Augustus, Was Making A Visit To Her Villa At Veii , An Eagle Flying By, Let Drop Upon Her Lap A Hen, With A Sprig Of Laurel In Her Mouth, Just As She Had Seized It. Livia Gave Orders To Have The Hen Taken Care Of, And The Sprig Of Laurel Set; And The Hen Reared Such A Numerous Brood Of Chickens, That The Villa, To This Day, Is Called The Villa Of The Hens . The Laurel Groves Flourished So Much, That The Caesars Procured Thence The Boughs And Crowns They Bore At Their Triumphs. It Was Also Their Constant Custom To Plant Others On The Same Spot, Immediately After A Triumph; And It Was Observed That, A Little Before The Death Of Each Prince, The Tree Which Had Been Set By Him Died Away. But In The Last Year Of Nero, The Whole Plantation Of Laurels Perished To The Very Roots, And The Hens All Died. About The Same Time, The Temple Of The Caesars  Being Struck With Lightning, The Heads Of All The Statues In It Fell Off At Once; And Augustus’s Sceptre Was Dashed From His Hands.</a> <span class="flex">800</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="801">Ii. Nero Was Succeeded By Galba , Who Was Not In The Remotest Degree Allied To The Family Of The Caesars, But, Without Doubt, Of Very Noble Extraction, Being Descended From A Great And Ancient Family; For He Always Used To Put Amongst His Other Titles, Upon The Bases Of His Statues, His Being Great-grandson To Q. Catulus Capitolinus. And When He Came To  Be Emperor, He Set Up The Images Of His Ancestors In The Hall  Of The Palace; According To The Inscriptions On Which, He Carried Up His Pedigree On The Father’s Side To Jupiter; And By The Mother’s To Pasiphae, The Wife Of Minos.</a> <span class="flex">801</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="802">Iii. To Give Even A Short Account Of The Whole Family, Would Be Tedious. I Shall, Therefore, Only Slightly Notice That Branch Of It From Which He Was Descended. Why, Or Whence, The First Of The Sulpicii Who Had The Cognomen Of Galba, Was So Called, Is Uncertain. Some Are Of Opinion, That It Was Because He Set Fire To A City In Spain, After He Had A Long Time Attacked It To No Purpose, With Torches Dipped In The Gum Called Galbanum: Others Said He Was So Named, Because, In A Lingering Disease, He Made Use Of It As A Remedy, Wrapped Up In Wool: Others, On Account Of His Being Prodigiously Corpulent, Such A One Being Called, In The Language Of The Gauls, Galba; Or, On The Contrary, Because He Was Of A Slender Habit Of Body, Like Those Insects Which Breed In A Sort Of Oak, And Are Called Galbae. Sergius Galba, A Person Of Consular Rank , And The Most Eloquent Man Of His Time, Gave A Lustre To The Family. History Relates, That, When He Was Pro-praetor Of Spain, He Perfidiously Put To The Sword Thirty Thousand Lusitanians, And By That Means Gave Occasion To The War Of Viriatus . His Grandson Being Incensed Against Julius Caesar, Whose Lieutenant He Had Been In Gaul, Because He Was Through Him Disappointed Of The Consulship , Joined With Cassius And Brutus In The Conspiracy Against Him, For Which He Was Condemned By The Pedian Law. From Him Were Descended The Grandfather And Father Of The Emperor Galba. The Grandfather Was More Celebrated For His Application To Study, Than  For Any Figure He Made In The Government. For He Rose No Higher Than The Praetorship, But Published A Large And Not Uninteresting History. His Father Attained To The Consulship : He Was A Short Man And Hump-backed, But A Tolerable Orator, And An Industrious Pleader. He Was Twice Married: The First Of His Wives Was Mummia Achaica, Daughter Of Catulus, And Great-grand-daughter Of Lucius Mummius, Who Sacked Corinth ; And The Other, Livia Ocellina, A Very Rich And Beautiful Woman, By Whom It Is Supposed He Was Courted For The Nobleness Of His Descent. They Say, That She Was Farther Encouraged To Persevere In Her Advances, By An Incident Which Evinced The Great Ingenuousness Of His Disposition. Upon Her Pressing Her Suit, He Took An Opportunity, When They Were Alone, Of Stripping Off His Toga, And Showing Her The Deformity Of His Person, That He Might Not Be Thought To Impose Upon Her. He Had By Achaica Two Sons, Caius And Sergius. The Elder Of These, Caius , Having Very Much Reduced His Estate, Retired From Town, And Being Prohibited By Tiberius From Standing For A Pro-consulship In His Year, Put An End To His Own Life.</a> <span class="flex">802</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="803">Iv. The Emperor Sergius Galba Was Born In The Consulship Of M. Valerius Messala, And Cn. Lentulus, Upon The Ninth Of The Calends Of January [24Th December]  , In A Villa Standing Upon A Hill, Near Terracina, On The Left-hand Side Of The Road To Fundi . Being Adopted By His Step-mother , He Assumed The Name Of Livius, With The Cognomen Of Ocella, And Changed His Praenomen; For He Afterwards Used That Of Lucius, Instead Of Sergius, Until He Arrived At The Imperial Dignity. It Is Well Known, That When He Came Once, Amongst Other Boys Of His Own Age, To Pay His Respects To Augustus, The Latter, Pinching His Cheek, Said To Him, “And Thou, Child, Too, Wilt Taste Our Imperial Dignity.” Tiberius, Likewise, Being Told That He Would Come To Be Emperor, But At An Advanced Age, Exclaimed, “Let Him Live, Then, Since That Does Not Concern Me!” When His Grandfather Was Offering Sacrifice To  Avert Some Ill Omen From Lightning, The Entrails Of The Victim Were Snatched Out Of His Hand By An Eagle, And Carried Off Into An Oak-tree Loaded With Acorns. Upon This, The Soothsayers Said, That The Family Would Come To Be Masters Of The Empire, But Not Until Many Years Had Elapsed: At Which He, Smiling, Said, “Ay, When A Mule Comes To Bear A Foal.” When Galba First Declared Against Nero, Nothing Gave Him So Much Confidence Of Success, As A Mule’s Happening At That Time To Have A Foal. And Whilst All Others Were Shocked At The Occurrence, As A Most Inauspicious Prodigy, He Alone Regarded It As A Most Fortunate Omen, Calling To Mind The Sacrifice And Saying Of His Grandfather. When He Took Upon Him The Manly Habit, He Dreamt That The Goddess Fortune Said To Him, “I Stand Before Your Door Weary; And Unless I Am Speedily Admitted, I Shall Fall Into The Hands Of The First Who Comes To Seize Me.” On His Awaking, When The Door Of The House Was Opened, He Found A Brazen Statue Of The Goddess, Above A Cubit Long, Close To The Threshold, Which He Carried With Slim To Tusculum, Where He Used To Pass The Summer Season; And Having Consecrated It In An Apartment Of His House, He Ever After Worshipped It With A Monthly Sacrifice, And An Anniversary Vigil. Though But A Very Young Man, He Kept Up An Ancient But Obsolete Custom, And Now Nowhere Observed, Except In His Own Family, Which Was, To Have His Freedmen And Slaves Appear In A Body Before Him Twice A Day, Morning And Evening, To Offer Him Their Salutations.</a> <span class="flex">803</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="804">V. Amongst Other Liberal Studies, He Applied Himself To The Law. He Married Lepida , By Whom He Had Two Sons; But The Mother And Children All Dying, He Continued A Widower; Nor Could He Be Prevailed Upon To Marry Again, Not Even Agrippina Herself, At That Time Left A Widow By The Death Of Domitius, Who Had Employed All Her Blandishments To Allure Him To Her Embraces, While He Was A Married Man; Insomuch That Lepida’s Mother, When In Company With Several Married Women, Rebuked Her For It, And Even Went So Far As To Cuff Her. Most Of All, He Courted The Empress Livia , By Whose Favour, While She Was Living, He Made A Considerable Figure, And Narrowly Missed Being Enriched By The Will Which She Left At Her Death; In Which She Distinguished Him From The Rest Of The  Legatees, By A Legacy Of Fifty Millions Of Sesterces. But Because The Sum Was Expressed In Figures, And Not In Words At Length, It Was Reduced By Her Heir, Tiberius, To Five Hundred Thousand: And Even This He Never Received.</a> <span class="flex">804</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="805">Vi. Filling The Great Offices Before The Age Required For It By Law, During His Praetorship, At The Celebration Of Games In Honour Of The Goddess Flora, He Presented The New Spectacle Of Elephants Walking Upon Ropes. He Was Then Governor Of The Province Of Aquitania For Near A Year, And Soon Afterwards Took The Consulship In The Usual Course, And Held It For Six Months . It So Happened That He Succeeded L. Domitius, The Father Of Nero, And Was Succeeded By Salvius Otho, Father To The Emperor Of That Name; So That His Holding It Between The Sons Of These Two Men, Looked Like A Presage Of His Future Advancement To The Empire. Being Appointed By Caius Caesar To Supersede Gaetulicus In His Command, The Day After His Joining The Legions, He Put A Stop To Their Plaudits In A Public Spectacle, By Issuing An Order, “That They Should Keep Their Hands Under Their Cloaks.” Immediately Upon Which, The Following Verse Became Very Common In The Camp:</a> <span class="flex">805</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="808">Vii. Upon The News Of Caius’s Death, Though Many Earnestly Pressed Him To Lay Hold Of That Opportunity Of Seizing The Empire, He Chose Rather To Be Quiet. On This Account, He Was In Great Favour With Claudius, And Being Received Into The Number Of His Friends, Stood So High In His Good Opinion, That The Expedition To Britain  Was For Some Time Suspended, Because He Was Suddenly Seized With A Slight Indisposition. He Governed Africa, As Pro-consul, For Two Years; Being Chosen Out Of The Regular Course To Restore Order In The Province, Which Was In Great Disorder From Civil Dissensions, And The Alarms Of The Barbarians. His Administration Was Distinguished By Great Strictness And Equity, Even In Matters Of Small Importance. A Soldier Upon Some Expedition Being Charged With Selling, In A Great Scarcity Of Corn, A Bushel Of Wheat, Which Was All He Had Left, For A Hundred Denarii, He Forbad Him To Be Relieved By Any Body, When He Came To Be In Want Himself; And Accordingly He Died Of Famine. When Sitting In Judgment, A Cause Being Brought Before Him About Some Beast Of Burden, The Ownership Of Which Was Claimed By Two Persons; The Evidence Being Slight On Both Sides, And It Being Difficult To Come At The Truth, He Ordered The Beast To Be Led To A Pond At Which He Had Used To Be Watered, With His Head Muffled Up, And The Covering Being There Removed, That He Should Be The Property Of The Person Whom He Followed Of His Own Accord, After Drinking.</a> <span class="flex">808</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="809">Viii. For His Achievements, Both At This Time In Africa, And Formerly In Germany, He Received The Triumphal Ornaments, And Three Sacerdotal Appointments, One Among The Fifteen, Another In The College Of Titius, And A Third Amongst The Augustals; And From That Time To The Middle Of Nero’s Reign, He Lived For The Most Part In Retirement. He Never Went Abroad  So Much As To Take The Air, Without A Carriage Attending Him, In Which There Was A Million Of Sesterces In Gold, Ready At Hand; Until At Last, At The Time He Was Living In The Town Of Fundi, The Province Of Hispania Tarraconensis Was Offered Him. After His Arrival In The Province, Whilst He Was Sacrificing In A Temple, A Boy Who Attended With A Censer, Became All On A Sudden Grey-headed. This Incident Was Regarded By Some As A Token Of An Approaching Revolution In The Government, And That An Old Man Would Succeed A Young One: That Is, That He Would Succeed Nero. And Not Long After, A Thunderbolt Falling Into A Lake In Cantabria , Twelve Axes Were Found In It; A Manifest Sign Of The Supreme Power.</a> <span class="flex">809</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="810">Ix. He Governed The Province During Eight Years, His Administration Being Of An Uncertain And Capricious Character. At First He Was Active, Vigorous, And Indeed Excessively Severe, In The Punishment Of Offenders. For, A Money-dealer Having Committed Some Fraud In The Way Of His Business, He Cut Off His Hands, And Nailed Them To His Counter. Another, Who Had Poisoned An Orphan, To Whom He Was Guardian, And Next Heir To The Estate, He Crucified. On This Delinquent Imploring The Protection Of The Law, And Crying Out That He Was A Roman Citizen, He Affected To Afford Him Some Alleviation, And To Mitigate His Punishment, By A Mark Of Honour, Ordered A Cross, Higher Than Usual, And Painted White, To Be Erected For Him. But By Degrees He Gave Himself Up To A Life Of Indolence And Inactivity, From The Fear Of Giving Nero Any Occasion Of Jealousy, And Because, As He Used To Say, “Nobody Was Obliged To Render An Account Of Their Leisure Hours.” He Was Holding A Court Of Justice On The Circuit At New Carthage , When He Received Intelligence Of The Insurrection In Gaul ; And While The Lieutenant Of Aquitania Was Soliciting His Assistance, Letters Were Brought From Vindex, Requesting Him “To Assert The Rights Of Mankind, And Put Himself At Their Head To Relieve Them From The Tyranny Of Nero.” Without Any Long Demur, He Accepted The Invitation, From A Mixture Of Fear And Hope. For He Had Discovered That Private Orders Had Been Sent By Nero To His Procurators In The Province To Get  Him Dispatched; And He Was Encouraged To The Enterprise, As Well By Several Auspices And Omens, As By The Prophecy Of A Young Woman Of Good, Family. The More So, Because The Priest Of Jupiter At Clunia , Admonished By A Dream, Had Discovered In The Recesses Of The Temple Some Verses Similar To Those In Which She Had Delivered Her Prophecy. These Had Also Been Uttered By A Girl Under Divine Inspiration, About Two Hundred Years Before. The Import Of The Verses Was, “That In Time, Spain Should Give The World A Lord And Master.”</a> <span class="flex">810</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="811">X. Taking His Seat On The Tribunal, Therefore, As If There Was No Other Business Than The Manumitting Of Slaves, He Had The Effigies Of A Number Of Persons Who Had Been Condemned And Put To Death By Nero, Set Up Before Him, Whilst A Noble Youth Stood By, Who Had Been Banished, And Whom He Had Purposely Sent For From One Of The Neighbouring Balearic Isles; And Lamenting The Condition Of The Times, And Being Thereupon Unanimously Saluted By The Title Of Emperor, He Publicly Declared Himself “Only The Lieutenant Of The Senate And People Of Rome.” Then Shutting The Courts, He Levied Legions And Auxiliary Troops Among The Provincials, Besides His Veteran Army Consisting Of One Legion, Two Wings Of Horse, And Three Cohorts. Out Of The Military Leaders Most Distinguished For Age And Prudence, He Formed A Kind Of Senate, With Whom To Advise Upon All Matters Of Importance, As Often As Occasion Should Require. He Likewise Chose Several Young Men Of The Equestrian Order, Who Were To Be Allowed The Privilege Of Wearing The Gold Ring, And, Being Called “The Reserve,” Should Mount Guard Before His Bed-chamber, Instead Of The Legionary Soldiers. He Likewise Issued Proclamations Throughout The Provinces Of The Empire, Exhorting All To Rise In Arms Unanimously, And Aid The Common Cause, By All The Ways And Means In Their Power. About The Same Time, In Fortifying A Town, Which He Had Pitched Upon For A Military Post, A Ring Was Found, Of Antique Workmanship, In The Stone Of Which Was Engraved The Goddess Victory With A Trophy. Presently After, A Ship Of Alexandria Arrived At Dertosa , Loaded With Arms, Without Any Person To Steer It, Or So Much As A Single Sailor Or Passenger  On Board. From This Incident, Nobody Entertained The Least Doubt But The War Upon Which They Were Entering Was Just And Honourable, And Favoured Likewise By The Gods; When All On A Sudden The Whole Design Was Exposed To Failure. One Of The Two Wings Of Horse, Repenting Of The Violation Of Their Oath To Nero, Attempted To Desert Him Upon His Approach To The Camp, And Were With Some Difficulty Kept In Their Duty. And Some Slaves Who Had Been Presented To Him By A Freedman Of Nero’s, On Purpose To Murder Him, Had Like To Have Killed Him As He Went Through A Narrow Passage To The Bath. Being Overheard To Encourage One Another Not To Lose The Opportunity, They Were Called To An Account Concerning It; And Recourse Being Had To The Torture, A Confession Was Extorted From Them.</a> <span class="flex">811</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="812">Xi. These Dangers Were Followed By The Death Of Vindex, At Which Being Extremely Discouraged, As If Fortune Had Quite Forsaken Him, He Had Thoughts Of Putting An End To His Own Life; But Receiving Advice By His Messengers From Rome That Nero Was Slain, And That All Had Taken An Oath To Him As Emperor, He Laid Aside The Title Of Lieutenant, And Took Upon Him That Of Caesar. Putting Himself Upon His March In His General’s Cloak, And A Dagger Hanging From His Neck Before His Breast, He Did Not Resume The Use Of The Toga, Until Nymphidius Sabinus, Prefect Of The Pretorian Guards At Rome, With The Two Lieutenants, Fonteius Capito In Germany, And Claudius Macer In Africa, Who Opposed His Advancement, Were All Put Down.</a> <span class="flex">812</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="813">Xii. Rumours Of His Cruelty And Avarice Had Reached The City Before His Arrival; Such As That He Had Punished Some Cities Of Spain And Gaul, For Not Joining Him Readily, By The Imposition Of Heavy Taxes, And Some By Levelling Their Walls; And Had Put To Death The Governors And Procurators With Their Wives And Children: Likewise That A Golden Crown, Of Fifteen Pounds Weight, Taken Out Of The Temple Of Jupiter, With Which He Was Presented By The People Of Tarracona, He Had Melted Down, And Had Exacted From Them Three Ounces Which Were Wanting In The Weight. This Report Of Him Was Confirmed And Increased, As Soon As He Entered The Town. For Some Seamen Who Had Been Taken From The Fleet, And Enlisted  Among The Troops By Nero, He Obliged To Return To Their Former Condition; But They Refusing To Comply, And Obstinately Clinging To The More Honourable Service Under Their Eagles And Standards, He Not Only Dispersed Them By A Body Of Horse, But Likewise Decimated Them. He Also Disbanded A Cohort Of Germans, Which Had Been Formed By The Preceding Emperors, For Their Body-guard, And Upon Many Occasions Found Very Faithful; And Sent Them Back Into Their Own Country, Without Giving Them Any Gratuity, Pretending That They Were More Inclined To Favour The Advancement Of Cneius Dolabella, Near Whose Gardens They Encamped, Than His Own. The Following Ridiculous Stories Were Also Related Of Him; But Whether With Or Without Foundation, I Know Not; Such As, That When A More Sumptuous Entertainment Than Usual Was Served Up, He Fetched A Deep Groan: That When One Of The Stewards Presented Him With An Account Of His Expenses, He Reached Him A Dish Of Legumes From His Table As A Reward For His Care And Diligence; And When Canus, The Piper, Had Played Much To His Satisfaction, He Presented Him, With His Own Hand, Five Denarii Taken Out Of His Pocket.</a> <span class="flex">813</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="814">Xiii. His Arrival, Therefore, In Town Was Not Very Agreeable To The People; And This Appeared At The Next Public Spectacle. For When The Actors In A Farce Began A Well-known Song,</a> <span class="flex">814</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="815">Xiv. He Possessed Himself Of The Imperial Power With More Favour And Authority Than He Administered It, Although He Gave Many Proofs Of His Being An Excellent Prince: But These Were Not So Grateful To The People, As His Misconduct Was Offensive. He Was Governed By Three Favourites, Who, Because They Lived In The Palace, And Were Constantly About Him, Obtained The Name Of His Pedagogues. These Were Titus Vinius, Who Had Been His Lieutenant In Spain, A Man Of Insatiable  Avarice; Cornelius Laco, Who, From An Assessor To The Prince, Was Advanced To Be Prefect Of The Pretorian Guards, A Person Of Intolerable Arrogance, As Well As Indolence; And His Freedman Icelus, Dignified A Little Before With The Privilege Of Wearing The Gold Ring, And The Use Of The Cognomen Martianus, Who Became A Candidate For The Highest Honour Within The Reach Of Any Person Of The Equestrian Order . He Resigned Himself So Implicitly Into The Power Of Those Three Favourites, Who Governed In Every Thing According To The Capricious Impulse Of Their Vices And Tempers, And His Authority Was So Much Abused By Them, That The Tenor Of His Conduct Was Not Very Consistent With Itself. At One Time, He Was More Rigorous And Frugal, At Another, More Lavish And Negligent, Than Became A Prince Who Had Been Chosen By The People, And Was So Far Advanced In Years. He Condemned Some Men Of The First Rank In The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders, Upon A Very Slight Suspicion, And Without Trial. He Rarely Granted The Freedom Of The City To Any One; And The Privilege Belonging To Such As Had Three Children, Only To One Or Two; And That With Great Difficulty, And Only For A Limited Time. When The Judges Petitioned To Have A Sixth Decury Added To Their Number, He Not Only Denied Them, But Abolished The Vacation Which Had Been Granted Them By Claudius For The Winter, And The Beginning Of The Year.</a> <span class="flex">815</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="816">Xv. It Was Thought That He Likewise Intended To Reduce The Offices Held By Senators And Men Of The Equestrian Order, To A Term Of Two Years’ Continuance; And To Bestow Them Only On Those Who Were Unwilling To Accept Them, And Had Refused Them. All The Grants Of Nero He Recalled, Saving Only The Tenth Part Of Them. For This Purpose He Gave A Commission To Fifty Roman Knights; With Orders, That If Players Or Wrestlers Had Sold What Had Been Formerly Given Them, It Should Be Exacted From The Purchasers, Since The Others, Having, No Doubt, Spent The Money, Were Not In A Condition To Pay. But On The Other Hand, He Suffered His Attendants And Freedmen To Sell Or Give Away The Revenue Of The State, Or Immunities From Taxes, And To Punish The Innocent, Or Pardon Criminals, At Pleasure. Nay, When The Roman People Were Very Clamorous For The Punishment Of Halotus And Tigellinus, Two Of The  Most Mischievous Amongst All The Emissaries Of Nero, He Protected Them, And Even Bestowed On Halotus One Of The Best Procurations In His Disposal. And As To Tigellinus, He Even Reprimanded The People For Their Cruelty By A Proclamation.</a> <span class="flex">816</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="817">Xvi. By This Conduct, He Incurred The Hatred Of All Orders Of The People, But Especially Of The Soldiery. For Their Commanders Having Promised Them In His Name A Donative Larger Than Usual, Upon Their Taking The Oath To Him Before His Arrival At Rome; He Refused To Make It Good, Frequently Bragging, “That It Was His Custom To Choose His Soldiers, Not Buy Them.” Thus The Troops Became Exasperated Against Him In All Quarters. The Pretorian Guards He Alarmed With Apprehensions Of Danger And Unworthy Treatment; Disbanding Many Of Them Occasionally As Disaffected To His Government, And Favourers Of Nymphidius. But Most Of All, The Army In Upper Germany Was Incensed Against Him, As Being Defrauded Of The Rewards Due To Them For The Service They Had Rendered In The Insurrection Of The Gauls Under Vindex. They Were, Therefore, The First Who Ventured To Break Into Open Mutiny, Refusing Upon The Calends [The 1St] Of January, To Take Any Oath Of Allegiance, Except To The Senate; And They Immediately Dispatched Deputies To The Pretorian Troops, To Let Them Know, “They Did Not Like The Emperor Who Had Been Set Up In Spain,” And To Desire That “They Would Make Choice Of Another, Who Might Meet With The Approbation Of All The Armies.”</a> <span class="flex">817</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="818">Xvii. Upon Receiving Intelligence Of This, Imagining That He Was Slighted Not So Much On Account Of His Age, As For Having No Children, He Immediately Singled Out Of A Company Of Young Persons Of Rank, Who Came To Pay Their Compliments To Him, Piso Frugi Licinianus, A Youth Of Noble Descent And Great Talents, For Whom He Had Before Contracted Such A Regard, That He Had Appointed Him In His Will The Heir Both Of His Estate And Name. Him He Now Styled His Son, And Taking Him To The Camp, Adopted Him In The Presence Of The Assembled Troops, But Without Making Any Mention Of A Donative. This Circumstance Afforded The Better Opportunity To Marcus Salvius Otho Of Accomplishing His Object, Six Days After The Adoption.</a> <span class="flex">818</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="819">Xviii. Many Remarkable Prodigies Had Happened From The  Very Beginning Of His Reign, Which Forewarned Him Of His Approaching Fate. In Every Town Through Which He Passed In His Way From Spain To Rome, Victims Were Slain On The Right And Left Of The Roads; And One Of These, Which Was A Bull, Being Maddened With The Stroke Of The Axe, Broke The Rope With Which It Was Tied, And Running Straight Against His Chariot, With His Fore-feet Elevated, Bespattered Him With Blood. Likewise, As He Was Alighting, One Of The Guard, Being Pushed Forward By The Crowd, Had Very Nearly Wounded Him With His Lance. And Upon His Entering The City And, Afterwards, The Palace, He Was Welcomed With An Earthquake, And A Noise Like The Bellowing Of Cattle. These Signs Of Ill-fortune Were Followed By Some That Were Still More Apparently Such. Out Of All His Treasures He Had Selected A Necklace Of Pearls And Jewels, To Adorn His Statue Of Fortune At Tusculum. But It Suddenly Occurring To Him That It Deserved A More August Place, He Consecrated It To The Capitoline Venus; And Next Night, He Dreamt That Fortune Appeared To Him, Complaining That She Had Been Defrauded Of The Present Intended Her, And Threatening To Resume What She Had Given Him. Terrified At This Denunciation, At Break Of Day He Sent Forward Some Persons To Tusculum, To Make Preparations For A Sacrifice Which Might Avert The Displeasure Of The Goddess; And When He Himself Arrived At The Place, He Found Nothing But Some Hot Embers Upon The Altar, And An Old Man In Black Standing By, Holding A Little Incense In A Glass, And Some Wine In An Earthern Pot. It Was Remarked, Too, That Whilst He Was Sacrificing Upon The Calends Of January, The Chaplet Fell From His Head, And Upon His Consulting The Pullets For Omens, They Flew Away. Farther, Upon The Day Of His Adopting Piso, When He Was To Harangue The Soldiers, The Seat Which He Used Upon Those Occasions, Through The Neglect Of His Attendants, Was Not Placed, According To Custom, Upon His Tribunal; And In The Senate-house, His Curule Chair Was Set With The Back Forward.</a> <span class="flex">819</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="820">Xix. The Day Before He Was Slain, As He Was Sacrificing In The Morning, The Augur Warned Him From Time To Time To Be Upon His Guard, For That He Was In Danger From Assassins, And That They Were Near At Hand. Soon After, He Was Informed, That Otho Was In Possession Of The Pretorian Camp. And Though Most Of His Friends Advised Him To Repair Thither Immediately,  In Hopes That He Might Quell The Tumult By His Authority And Presence, He Resolved To Do Nothing More Than Keep Close Within The Palace, And Secure Himself By Guards Of The Legionary Soldiers, Who Were Quartered In Different Parts About The City. He Put On A Linen Coat Of Mail, However, Remarking At The Same Time, That It Would Avail Him Little Against The Points Of So Many Swords. But Being Tempted Out By False Reports, Which The Conspirators Had Purposely Spread To Induce Him To Venture Abroad—some Few Of Those About Him Too Hastily Assuring Him That The Tumult Had Ceased, The Mutineers Were Apprehended, And The Rest Coming To Congratulate Him, Resolved To Continue Firm In Their Obedience—he Went Forward To Meet Them With So Much Confidence, That Upon A Soldier’s Boasting That He Had Killed Otho, He Asked Him, “By What Authority?” And Proceeded As Far As The Forum. There The Knights, Appointed To Dispatch Him, Making Their Way Through The Crowd Of Citizens, Upon Seeing Him At A Distance, Halted A While; After Which, Galloping Up To Him, Now Abandoned By All His Attendants, They Put Him To Death.</a> <span class="flex">820</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="821">Xx. Some Authors Relate, That Upon Their First Approach He Cried Out, “What Do You Mean, Fellow-soldiers? I Am Yours, And You Are Mine,” And Promised Them A Donative: But The Generality Of Writers Relate, That He Offered His Throat To Them, Saying, “Do Your Work, And Strike, Since You Are Resolved Upon It.” It Is Remarkable, That Not One Of Those Who Were At Hand, Ever Made Any Attempt To Assist The Emperor; And All Who Were Sent For, Disregarded The Summons, Except A Troop Of Germans. They, In Consideration Of His Late Kindness In Showing Them Particular Attention During A Sickness Which Prevailed In The Camp, Flew To His Aid, But Came Too Late; For, Being Not Well Acquainted With The Town, They Had Taken A Circuitous Route. He Was Slain Near The Curtian Lake , And There Left, Until A Common Soldier Returning From The Receipt Of His Allowance Of Corn, Throwing Down The Load Which He Carried, Cut Off His Head. There Being Upon It No Hair, By Which He Might Hold It, He Hid It In The Bosom Of His Dress; But Afterwards Thrusting His Thumb Into The Mouth, He Carried It In That Manner To Otho, Who Gave It To The Drudges And Slaves Who Attended The Soldiers; And They, Fixing It Upon The  Point Of A Spear, Carried It In Derision Round The Camp, Crying Out As They Went Along, “You Take Your Fill Of Joy In Your Old Age.” They Were Irritated To This Pitch Of Rude Banter, By A Report Spread A Few Days Before, That, Upon Some One’s Commending His Person As Still Florid And Vigorous, He Replied,</a> <span class="flex">821</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="823">Xxi. In Person He Was Of A Good Size, Bald Before, With Blue Eyes, And An Aquiline Nose; And His Hands And Feet Were So Distorted With The Gout, That He Could Neither Wear A Shoe, Nor Turn Over The Leaves Of A Book, Or So Much As Hold It. He Had Likewise An Excrescence In His Right Side, Which Hung Down To That Degree, That It Was With Difficulty Kept Up By A Bandage.</a> <span class="flex">823</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="824">Xxii. He Is Reported To Have Been A Great Eater, And Usually Took His Breakfast In The Winter-time Before Day. At Supper, He Fed Very Heartily, Giving The Fragments Which Were Left, By Handfuls, To Be Distributed Amongst The Attendants. In His Lust, He Was More Inclined To The Male Sex, And Such Of Them Too As Were Old. It Is Said Of Him, That In Spain, When Icelus, An Old Catamite Of His, Brought Him The News Of Nero’s Death, He Not Only Kissed Him Lovingly Before Company, But Begged Of Him To Remove All Impediments, And Then Took Him Aside Into A Private Apartment.</a> <span class="flex">824</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="825">Xxiii. He Perished In The Seventy-third Year Of His Age, And The Seventh Month Of His Reign . The Senate, As Soon As They Could With Safety, Ordered A Statue To Be Erected For Him Upon The Naval Column, In That Part Of The Forum Where He  Was Slain. But Vespasian Cancelled The Decree, Upon A Suspicion That He Had Sent Assassins From Spain Into Judaea To Murder Him.</a> <span class="flex">825</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="828">I. The Ancestors Of Otho Were Originally Of The Town Of Ferentum, Of An Ancient And Honourable Family, And, Indeed, One Of The Most Considerable In Etruria. His Grandfather, M. Salvius Otho  Much As Wish To Have Children That Should Be Better.” He Had Two Sons By A Very Noble Woman, Albia Terentia, Namely; Lucius Titianus, And A Younger Called Marcus, Who Had The Same Cognomen As Himself. He Had Also A Daughter, Whom He Contracted To Drusus, Germanicus’s Son, Before She Was Of Marriageable Age.</a> <span class="flex">828</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="829">Ii. The Emperor Otho Was Born Upon The Fourth Of The Calends Of May [28Th April], In The Consulship Of Camillus Aruntius And Domitius Aenobarbus . He Was From His Earliest Youth So Riotous And Wild, That He Was Often Severely Scourged By His Father. He Was Said To Run About In The Night-time, And Seize Upon Any One He Met, Who Was Either Drunk Or Too Feeble To Make Resistance, And Toss Him In A Blanket . After His Father’s Death, To Make His Court The More Effectually To A Freedwoman About The Palace, Who Was In Great Favour, He Pretended To Be In Love With Her, Though She Was Old, And Almost Decrepit. Having By Her Means Got Into Nero’s Good Graces, He Soon Became One Of The Principal Favourites, By The Congeniality Of His Disposition To That Of The Emperor Or, As Some Say, By The Reciprocal Practice Of Mutual Pollution. He Had So Great A Sway At Court, That When A Man Of Consular Rank Was Condemned For Bribery, Having Tampered With Him For A Large Sum Of Money, To Procure His Pardon; Before He Had Quite Effected It, He Scrupled Not To Introduce Him Into The Senate, To Return His Thanks.</a> <span class="flex">829</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="830">Iii. Having, By Means Of This Woman, Insinuated Himself Into All The Emperor’s Secrets, He, Upon The Day Designed For The Murder Of His Mother, Entertained Them Both At A Very Splendid Feast, To Prevent Suspicion. Poppaea Sabina, For Whom Nero Entertained Such A Violent Passion That He Had Taken Her From Her Husband  And Entrusted Her To Him, He Received, And Went Through The Form Of Marrying Her. And Not Satisfied With Obtaining Her Favours, He Loved Her So Extravagantly, That He Could Not With Patience Bear Nero For His Rival. It Is Certainly Believed That He Not Only Refused Admittance To Those Who Were Sent By Nero To Fetch Her, But That, On One  Occasion, He Shut Him Out, And Kept Him Standing Before The Door, Mixing Prayers And Menaces In Vain, And Demanding Back Again What Was Entrusted To His Keeping. His Pretended Marriage, Therefore, Being Dissolved, He Was Sent Lieutenant Into Lusitania. This Treatment Of Him Was Thought Sufficiently Severe, Because Harsher Proceedings Might Have Brought The Whole Farce To Light, Which, Notwithstanding, At Last Came Out, And Was Published To The World In The Following Distich:—</a> <span class="flex">830</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="832">Iv. As Soon As An Opportunity Of Revenge Offered, He Readily Joined In Galba’s Enterprises, And At The Same Time Conceived Hopes Of Obtaining The Imperial Dignity For Himself. To This He Was Much Encouraged By The State Of The Times, But Still More By The Assurances Given Him By Seleucus, The Astrologer, Who, Having Formerly Told Him That He Would Certainly Out-live Nero, Came To Him At That Juncture Unexpectedly, Promising Him Again That He Should Succeed To The Empire, And That In A Very Short Time. He, Therefore, Let Slip No Opportunity Of Making His Court To Every One About Him By All Manner Of Civilities. As Often As He Entertained Galba At Supper, He Distributed To Every Man Of The Cohort Which Attended The Emperor On Guard, A Gold Piece; Endeavouring Likewise To Oblige The Rest Of The Soldiers In One Way Or Another. Being Chosen An Arbitrator By One Who Had A Dispute With His Neighbour About A Piece Of Land, He Bought It, And Gave It Him; So That Now Almost Every Body Thought And Said, That He Was The Only Man Worthy Of Succeeding To The Empire.</a> <span class="flex">832</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="833">V. He Entertained Hopes Of Being Adopted By Galba, And Expected It Every Day. But Finding Himself Disappointed, By Piso’s Being Preferred Before Him, He Turned His Thoughts To Obtaining His Purpose By The Use Of Violence; And To This He Was Instigated, As Well By The Greatness Of His Debts, As By Resentment  At Galba’s Conduct Towards Him. For He Did Not Conceal His Conviction, “That He Could Not Stand His Ground Unless He Became Emperor, And That It Signified Nothing Whether He Fell By The Hands Of His Enemies In The Field, Or Of His Creditors In The Forum.” He Had A Few Days Before Squeezed Out Of One Of The Emperor’s Slaves A Million Of Sesterces For Procuring Him A Stewardship; And This Was The Whole Fund He Had For Carrying On So Great An Enterprise. At First The Design Was Entrusted To Only Five Of The Guard, But Afterwards To Ten Others, Each Of The Five Naming Two. They Had Every One Ten Thousand Sesterces Paid Down, And Were Promised Fifty Thousand More. By These, Others Were Drawn In, But Not Many; From A Confident Assurance, That When The Matter Came To The Crisis, They Should Have Enough To Join Them.</a> <span class="flex">833</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="834">Vi. His First Intention Was, Immediately After The Departure Of Piso, To Seize The Camp, And Fall Upon Galba, Whilst He Was At Supper In The Palace; But He Was Restrained By A Regard For The Cohort At That Time On Duty, Lest He Should Bring Too Great An Odium Upon It; Because It Happened That The Same Cohort Was On Guard Before, Both When Caius Was Slain, And Nero Deserted. For Some Time Afterwards, He Was Restrained Also By Scruples About The Omens, And By The Advice Of Seleucus. Upon The Day Fixed At Last For The Enterprise, Having Given His Accomplices Notice To Wait For Him In The Forum Near The Temple Of Saturn, At The Gilded Mile-stone , He Went In The Morning To Pay His Respects To Galba; And Being Received With A Kiss As Usual, He Attended Him At Sacrifice, And Heard The Predictions Of The Augur . A Freedman Of His, Then Bringing  Him Word That The Architects Were Come, Which Was The Signal Agreed Upon, He Withdrew, As If It Were With A Design To View A House Upon Sale, And Went Out By A Back-door Of The Palace To The Place Appointed. Some Say He Pretended To Be Seized With An Ague Fit, And Ordered Those About Him To Make That Excuse For Him, If He Was Inquired After. Being Then Quickly Concealed In A Woman’s Litter, He Made The Best Of His Way For The Camp. But The Bearers Growing Tired, He Got Out, And Began To Run. His Shoe Becoming Loose, He Stopped Again, But Being Immediately Raised By His Attendants Upon Their Shoulders, And Unanimously Saluted By The Title Of Emperor, He Came Amidst Auspicious Acclamations And Drawn Swords Into The Principia  In The Camp; All Who Met Him Joining In The Cavalcade, As If They Had Been Privy To The Design. Upon This, Sending Some Soldiers To Dispatch Galba And Piso, He Said Nothing Else In His Address To The Soldiery, To Secure Their Affections, Than These Few Words: “I Shall Be Content With Whatever Ye Think Fit To Leave Me.”</a> <span class="flex">834</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="835">Vii. Towards The Close Of The Day, He Entered The Senate, And After He Had Made A Short Speech To Them, Pretending That He Had Been Seized In The Streets, And Compelled By Violence To Assume The Imperial Authority, Which He Designed To Exercise In Conjunction With Them, He Retired To The Palace. Besides Other Compliments Which He Received From Those Who Flocked About Him To Congratulate And Flatter Him, He Was Called Nero By The Mob, And Manifested No Intention Of Declining That Cognomen. Nay, Some Authors Relate, That He Used It In His Official Acts, And The First Letters He Sent To The  Governors Of Provinces. He Suffered All His Images And Statues To Be Replaced, And Restored His Procurators And Freedmen To Their Former Posts. And The First Writing Which He Signed As Emperor, Was A Promise Of Fifty Millions Of Sesterces To Finish The Golden-house . He Is Said To Have Been Greatly Frightened That Night In His Sleep, And To Have Groaned Heavily; And Being Found, By Those Who Came Running In To See What The Matter Was, Lying Upon The Floor Before His Bed, He Endeavoured By Every Kind Of Atonement To Appease The Ghost Of Galba, By Which He Had Found Himself Violently Tumbled Out Of Bed. The Next Day, As He Was Taking The Omens, A Great Storm Arising, And Sustaining A Grievous Fall, He Muttered To Himself From Time To Time:</a> <span class="flex">835</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="837">Viii. About The Same Time, The Armies In Germany Took An Oath To Vitellius As Emperor. Upon Receiving This Intelligence, He Advised The Senate To Send Thither Deputies, To Inform Them, That A Prince Had Been Already Chosen; And To Persuade Them To Peace And A Good Understanding. By Letters And Messages, However, He Offered Vitellius To Make Him His Colleague In The Empire, And His Son-in-law. But A War Being Now Unavoidable, And The Generals And Troops Sent Forward By Vitellius, Advancing, He Had A Proof Of The Attachment And Fidelity Of The Pretorian Guards, Which Had Nearly Proved Fatal To The Senatorian Order. It Had Been Judged Proper That Some Arms Should Be Given Out Of The Stores, And Conveyed To The Fleet By The Marine Troops. While They Were Employed In Fetching These From The Camp In The Night, Some Of The Guards Suspecting Treachery, Excited A Tumult; And Suddenly The Whole Body, Without Any Of Their Officers At Their Head, Ran To The Palace, Demanding That The Entire Senate Should Be Put To The Sword; And Having Repulsed Some Of The  Tribunes Who Endeavoured To Stop Them, And Slain Others, They Broke, All Bloody As They Were, Into The Banquetting Room, Inquiring For The Emperor; Nor Would They Quit The Place Until They Had Seen Him. He Now Entered Upon His Expedition Against Vitellius With Great Alacrity, But Too Much Precipitation, And Without Any Regard To The Ominous Circumstances Which Attended It. For The Ancilia  Had Been Taken Out Of The Temple Of Mars, For The Usual Procession, But Were Not Yet Replaced; During Which Interval It Had Of Old Been Looked Upon As Very Unfortunate To Engage In Any Enterprise. He Likewise Set Forward Upon The Day When The Worshippers Of The Mother Of The Gods  Begin Their Lamentations And Wailing. Besides These, Other Unlucky Omens Attended Him. For, In A Victim Offered To Father Dis , He Found The Signs Such As Upon All Other Occasions Are Regarded As Favourable; Whereas, In That Sacrifice, The Contrary Intimations Are Judged The Most Propitious. At His First Setting Forward, He Was Stopped By Inundations Of The Tiber; And At Twenty Miles’ Distance From The City, Found The Road Blocked Up By The Fall Of Houses.</a> <span class="flex">837</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="838">Ix. Though It Was The General Opinion That It Would Be Proper To Protract The War, As The Enemy Were Distressed By  Famine And The Straitness Of Their Quarters, Yet He Resolved With Equal Rashness To Force Them To An Engagement As Soon As Possible; Whether From Impatience Of Prolonged Anxiety, And In The Hope Of Bringing Matters To An Issue Before The Arrival Of Vitellius, Or Because He Could Not Resist The Ardour Of The Troops, Who Were All Clamorous For Battle. He Was Not, However, Present At Any Of Those Which Ensued, But Stayed Behind At Brixellum . He Had The Advantage In Three Slight Engagements, Near The Alps, About Placentia, And A Place Called Castor’s ; But Was, By A Fraudulent Stratagem Of The Enemy, Defeated In The Last And Greatest Battle, At Bedriacum . For, Some Hopes Of A Conference Being Given, And The Soldiers Being Drawn Up To Hear The Conditions Of Peace Declared, Very Unexpectedly, And Amidst Their Mutual Salutations, They Were Obliged To Stand To Their Arms. Immediately Upon This He Determined To Put An End To His Life, More, As Many Think, And Not Without Reason, Out Of Shame, At Persisting In A Struggle For The Empire To The Hazard Of The Public Interest And So Many Lives, Than From Despair, Or Distrust Of His Troops. For He Had Still In Reserve, And In Full Force, Those Whom He Had Kept About Him For A Second Trial Of His Fortune, And Others Were Coming Up From Dalmatia, Pannonia, And Moesia; Nor Were The Troops Lately Defeated So Far Discouraged As Not To Be Ready, Even Of Themselves, To Run All Risks In Order To Wipe Off Their Recent Disgrace.</a> <span class="flex">838</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="839">X. My Father, Suetonius Lenis , Was In This Battle, Being At  That Time An Angusticlavian Tribune In The Thirteenth Legion. He Used Frequently To Say, That Otho, Before His Advancement To The Empire, Had Such An Abhorrence Of Civil War, That Once, Upon Hearing An Account Given At Table Of The Death Of Cassius And Brutus, He Fell Into A Trembling, And That He Never Would Have Interfered With Galba, But That He Was Confident Of Succeeding In His Enterprise Without A War. Moreover, That He Was Then Encouraged To Despise Life By The Example Of A Common Soldier, Who Bringing News Of The Defeat Of The Army, And Finding That He Met With No Credit, But Was Railed At For A Liar And A Coward, As If He Had Run Away From The Field Of Battle, Fell Upon His Sword At The Emperor’s Feet; Upon The Sight Of Which, My Father Said That Otho Cried Out, “That He Would Expose To No Farther Danger Such Brave Men, Who Had Deserved So Well At His Hands.” Advising Therefore His Brother, His Brother’s Son, And The Rest Of His Friends, To Provide For Their Security In The Best Manner They Could, After He Had Embraced And Kissed Them, He Sent Them Away; And Then Withdrawing Into A Private Room By Himself, He Wrote A Letter Of Consolation To His Sister, Containing Two Sheets. He Likewise Sent Another To Messalina, Nero’s Widow, Whom He Had Intended To Marry, Committing To Her The Care Of His Relics And Memory. He Then Burnt All The Letters Which He Had By Him, To Prevent The Danger And Mischief That Might Otherwise Befall The Writers From The Conqueror. What Ready Money He Had, He Distributed Among His Domestics.</a> <span class="flex">839</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="840">Xi. And Now Being Prepared, And Just Upon The Point Of Dispatching Himself, He Was Induced To Suspend The Execution Of His Purpose By A Great Tumult Which Had Broken Out In The Camp. Finding That Some Of The Soldiers Who Were Making Off Had Been Seized And Detained As Deserters, “Let Us Add,” Said He, “This Night To Our Life.” These Were His Very Words.</a> <span class="flex">840</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="842">Xii. The Person And Appearance Of Otho No Way Corresponded To The Great Spirit He Displayed On This Occasion; For He Is Said To Have Been Of Low Stature, Splay-footed, And Bandy-legged. He Was, However, Effeminately Nice In The Care Of His Person: The Hair On His Body He Plucked Out By The Roots; And Because He Was Somewhat Bald, He Wore A Kind Of Peruke, So Exactly Fitted To His Head, That Nobody Could Have Known It For Such. He Used To Shave Every Day, And Rub His Face With Soaked Bread; The Use Of Which He Began When The Down First Appeared Upon His Chin, To Prevent His Having Any Beard. It Is Said Likewise That He Celebrated Publicly The Sacred Rites Of Isis , Clad In A Linen Garment, Such As Is Used By The Worshippers Of That Goddess. These Circumstances, I Imagine, Caused The World To Wonder The More That His Death Was So Little In Character With His Life. Many Of The Soldiers Who Were Present, Kissing And Bedewing With Their Tears His Hands And Feet As He Lay Dead, And Celebrating Him As “A Most Gallant Man, And An Incomparable Emperor,” Immediately Put An End To Their Own Lives Upon The Spot, Not Far From His Funeral Pile.</a> <span class="flex">842</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="845">Aulus Vitellius.</a> <span class="flex">845</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="846">I. Very Different Accounts Are Given Of The Origin Of The Vitellian Family. Some Describe It As Ancient And Noble, Others As Recent And Obscure, Nay, Extremely Mean. I Am Inclined To Think, That These Several Representations Have Been Made By The Flatterers And Detractors Of Vitellius, After He Became Emperor, Unless The Fortunes Of The Family Varied Before. There Is Extant A Memoir Addressed By Quintus Eulogius To Quintus Vitellius, Quaestor To The Divine Augustus, In Which It Is Said, That The Vitellii Were Descended From Faunus, King Of The Aborigines, And Vitellia , Who Was Worshipped In Many Places As A Goddess, And That They Reigned Formerly Over The Whole Of Latium: That All Who Were Left Of The Family Removed Out Of The Country Of The Sabines To Rome, And Were Enrolled Among The Patricians: That Some Monuments Of The Family Continued A Long Time; As The Vitellian Way, Reaching From The Janiculum To The Sea, And Likewise A Colony Of That Name, Which, At A Very Remote Period Of Time, They Desired Leave From The Government To Defend Against The Aequicolae , With A Force Raised By Their Own Family Only: Also That, In The Time Of The War With The Samnites, Some Of The Vitellii Who Went With The Troops Levied For The Security Of Apulia, Settled At Nuceria , And Their Descendants, A Long Time Afterwards, Returned Again To Rome, And Were Admitted  Into The Patrician Order. On The Other Hand, The Generality Of Writers Say That The Founder Of The Family Was A Freedman. Cassius Severus  And Some Others Relate That He Was Likewise A Cobbler, Whose Son Having Made A Considerable Fortune By Agencies And Dealings In Confiscated Property, Begot, By A Common Strumpet, Daughter Of One Antiochus, A Baker, A Child, Who Afterwards Became A Roman Knight. Of These Different Accounts The Reader Is Left To Take His Choice.</a> <span class="flex">846</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="847">Ii. It Is Certain, However, That Publius Vitellius, Of Nuceria, Whether Of An Ancient Family, Or Of Low Extraction, Was A Roman Knight, And A Procurator To Augustus. He Left Behind Him Four Sons, All Men Of Very High Station, Who Had The Same Cognomen, But The Different Praenomina Of Aulus, Quintus, Publius, And Lucius. Aulus Died In The Enjoyment Of The Consulship , Which Office He Bore Jointly With Domitius, The Father Of Nero Caesar. He Was Elegant To Excess In His Manner Of Living, And Notorious For The Vast Expense Of His Entertainments. Quintus Was Deprived Of His Rank Of Senator, When, Upon A Motion Made By Tiberius, A Resolution Passed To Purge The Senate Of Those Who Were In Any Respect Not Duly Qualified For That Honour. Publius, An Intimate Friend And Companion Of Germanicus, Prosecuted His Enemy And Murderer, Cneius Piso, And Procured Sentence Against Him. After He Had Been Made Proctor, Being Arrested Among The Accomplices Of Sejanus, And Delivered Into The Hands Of His Brother To Be Confined In His House, He Opened A Vein With A Penknife, Intending To Bleed Himself To Death. He Suffered, However, The Wound To Be Bound Up And Cured, Not So Much From Repenting The Resolution He Had Formed, As To Comply With The Importunity Of His Relations. He Died Afterwards A Natural Death During His Confinement. Lucius, After His Consulship , Was Made Governor Of Syria , And By His Politic Management Not Only Brought Artabanus, King Of The Parthians, To Give Him An Interview, But To Worship The Standards Of The Roman Legions. He Afterwards Filled Two Ordinary Consulships , And Also The Censorship  Jointly With The Emperor Claudius. Whilst That  Prince Was Absent Upon His Expedition Into Britain , The Care Of The Empire Was Committed To Him, Being A Man Of Great Integrity And Industry. But He Lessened His Character Not A Little, By His Passionate Fondness For An Abandoned Freedwoman, With Whose Spittle, Mixed With Honey, He Used To Anoint His Throat And Jaws, By Way Of Remedy For Some Complaint, Not Privately Nor Seldom, But Daily And Publicly. Being Extravagantly Prone To Flattery, It Was He Who Gave Rise To The Worship Of Caius Caesar As A God, When, Upon His Return From Syria, He Would Not Presume To Accost Him Any Otherwise Than With His Head Covered, Turning Himself Round, And Then Prostrating Himself Upon The Earth. And To Leave No Artifice Untried To Secure The Favour Of Claudius, Who Was Entirely Governed By His Wives And Freedmen, He Requested As The Greatest Favour From Messalina, That She Would Be Pleased To Let Him Take Off Her Shoes; Which, When He Had Done, He Took Her Right Shoe, And Wore It Constantly Betwixt His Toga And His Tunic, And From Time To Time Covered It With Kisses. He Likewise Worshipped Golden Images Of Narcissus And Pallas Among His Household Gods. It Was He, Too, Who, When Claudius Exhibited The Secular Games, In His Compliments To Him Upon That Occasion, Used This Expression, “May You Often Do The Same.”</a> <span class="flex">847</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="848">Iii. He Died Of Palsy, The Day After His Seizure With It, Leaving Behind Him Two Sons, Whom He Had By A Most Excellent And Respectable Wife, Sextilia. He Had Lived To See Them Both Consuls, The Same Year And During The Whole Year Also; The Younger Succeeding The Elder For The Last Six Months . The Senate Honoured Him After His Decease With A Funeral At The Public Expense, And With A Statue In The Rostra, Which Had This Inscription Upon The Base: “One Who Was Steadfast In His Loyalty To His Prince.” The Emperor Aulus Vitellius, The Son Of This Lucius, Was Born Upon The Eighth Of The Calends Of October [24Th September], Or, As Some Say, Upon The Seventh Of The Ides Of September [7Th September], In The Consulship Of Drusus Caesar And Norbanus Flaccus . His Parents Were So  Terrified With The Predictions Of Astrologers Upon The Calculation Of His Nativity, That His Father Used His Utmost Endeavours To Prevent His Being Sent Governor Into Any Of The Provinces, Whilst He Was Alive. His Mother, Upon His Being Sent To The Legions , And Also Upon His Being Proclaimed Emperor, Immediately Lamented Him As Utterly Ruined. He Spent His Youth Amongst The Catamites Of Tiberius At Capri, Was Himself Constantly Stigmatized With The Name Of Spintria , And Was Supposed To Have Been The Occasion Of His Father’s Advancement, By Consenting To Gratify The Emperor’s Unnatural Lust.</a> <span class="flex">848</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="849">Iv. In The Subsequent Part Of His Life, Being Still Most Scandalously Vicious, He Rose To Great Favour At Court; Being Upon A Very Intimate Footing With Caius [Caligula], Because Of His Fondness For Chariot-driving, And With Claudius For His Love Of Gaming. But He Was In A Still Higher Degree Acceptable To Nero, As Well On The Same Accounts, As For A Particular Service Which He Rendered Him. When Nero Presided In The Games Instituted By Himself, Though He Was Extremely Desirous To Perform Amongst The Harpers, Yet His Modesty Would Not Permit Him, Notwithstanding The People Entreated Much For It. Upon His Quitting The Theatre, Vitellius Fetched Him Back Again, Pretending To Represent The Determined Wishes Of The People, And So Afforded Him The Opportunity Of Yielding To Their In Treaties.</a> <span class="flex">849</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="850">V. By The Favour Of These Three Princes, He Was Not Only Advanced To The Great Offices Of State, But To The Highest Dignities Of The Sacred Order; After Which He Held The Proconsulship Of Africa, And Had The Superintendence Of The Public Works, In Which Appointment His Conduct, And, Consequently, His Reputation, Were Very Different. For He Governed The Province With Singular Integrity During Two Years, In The Latter Of Which He Acted As Deputy To His Brother, Who Succeeded Him. But In His Office In The City, He Was Said To Pillage The Temples Of Their Gifts And Ornaments, And To Have Exchanged Brass And Tin For Gold And Silver.</a> <span class="flex">850</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="851">Vi. He Took To Wife Petronia, The Daughter Of A Man Of Consular Rank, And Had By Her A Son Named Petronius, Who Was Blind Of An Eye. The Mother Being Willing To Appoint This Youth Her Heir, Upon Condition That He Should Be Released From His Father’s Authority, The Latter Discharged Him Accordingly; But Shortly After, As Was Believed, Murdered Him, Charging Him With A Design Upon His Life, And Pretending That He Had, From Consciousness Of His Guilt, Drank The Poison He Had Prepared For His Father. Soon Afterwards, He Married Galeria Fundana, The Daughter Of A Man Of Pretorian Rank, And Had By Her Both Sons And Daughters. Among The Former Was One Who Had Such A Stammering In His Speech, That He Was Little Better Than If He Had Been Dumb.</a> <span class="flex">851</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="852">Vii. He Was Sent By Galba Into Lower Germany , Contrary To His Expectation. It Is Supposed That He Was Assisted In Procuring This Appointment By The Interest Of Titus Junius, A Man Of Great Influence At That Time; Whose Friendship He Had Long Before Gained By Favouring The Same Set Of Charioteers With Him In The Circensian Games. But Galba Openly Declared That None Were Less To Be Feared Than Those Who Only Cared For Their Bellies, And That Even His Enormous Appetite Must Be Satisfied With The Plenty Of That Province; So That It Is Evident He Was Selected For That Government More Out Of Contempt Than Kindness. It Is Certain, That When He Was To Set Out, He Had Not Money For The Expenses Of His Journey; He Being At That Time So Much Straitened In His Circumstances, That He Was Obliged To Put His Wife And Children, Whom He Left At Rome, Into A Poor Lodging Which He Hired For Them, In Order That He Might Let His Own House For The Remainder Of The Year; And He Pawned A Pearl Taken From His Mother’s Ear-ring, To Defray His Expenses On The Road. A Crowd Of Creditors Who Were Waiting To Stop Him, And Amongst Them The People Of Sineussa And Formia, Whose Taxes He Had Converted To His Own Use, He Eluded, By Alarming Them With The Apprehension Of False Accusation. He Had, However, Sued A Certain Freedman, Who Was Clamorous In Demanding A Debt Of Him, Under Pretence That He Had Kicked Him; Which Action He Would Not Withdraw, Until He Had Wrung From The Freedman Fifty Thousand Sesterces. Upon His Arrival In The Province, The Army,  Which Was Disaffected To Galba, And Ripe For Insurrection, Received Him With Open Arms, As If He Had Been Sent Them From Heaven. It Was No Small Recommendation To Their Favour, That He Was The Son Of A Man Who Had Been Thrice Consul, Was In The Prime Of Life, And Of An Easy, Prodigal Disposition. This Opinion, Which Had Been Long Entertained Of Him, Vitellius Confirmed By Some Late Practices; Having Kissed All The Common Soldiers Whom He Met With Upon The Road, And Been Excessively Complaisant In The Inns And Stables To The Muleteers And Travellers; Asking Them In A Morning, If They Had Got Their Breakfasts, And Letting Them See, By Belching, That He Had Eaten His.</a> <span class="flex">852</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="853">Viii. After He Had Reached The Camp, He Denied No Man Any Thing He Asked For, And Pardoned All Who Lay Under Sentence For Disgraceful Conduct Or Disorderly Habits. Before A Month, Therefore, Had Passed, Without Regard To The Day Or Season, He Was Hurried By The Soldiers Out Of His Bed-chamber, Although It Was Evening, And He In An Undress, And Unanimously Saluted By The Title Of Emperor . He Was Then Carried Round The Most Considerable Towns In The Neighbourhood, With The Sword Of The Divine Julius In His Hand; Which Had Been Taken By Some Person Out Of The Temple Of Mars, And Presented To Him When He Was First Saluted. Nor Did He Return To The Pretorium, Until His Dining-room Was In Flames From The Chimney’s Taking Fire. Upon This Accident, All Being In Consternation, And Considering It As An Unlucky Omen, He Cried Out, “Courage, Boys! It Shines Brightly Upon Us.” And This Was All He Said To The Soldiers. The Army Of The Upper Province Likewise, Which Had Before Declared Against Galba For The Senate, Joining In The Proceedings, He Very Eagerly Accepted The Cognomen Of Germanicus, Offered Him By The Unanimous Consent Of Both Armies, But Deferred Assuming That Of Augustus, And Refused For Ever That Of Caesar.</a> <span class="flex">853</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="854">Ix. Intelligence Of Galba’s Death Arriving Soon After, When He Had Settled His Affairs In Germany He Divided His Troops Into Two Bodies, Intending To Send One Of Them Before Him Against Otho, And To Follow With The Other Himself. The Army He Sent Forward Had A Lucky Omen; For, Suddenly, An Eagle Cams Flying Up To Them On The Right, And Having Hovered  Round The Standards, Flew Gently Before Them On Their Road. But, On The Other Hand, When He Began His Own March, All The Equestrian Statues, Which Were Erected For Him In Several Places, Fell Suddenly Down With Their Legs Broken; And The Laurel Crown, Which He Had Put On As Emblematical Of Auspicious Fortune, Fell Off His Head Into A River. Soon Afterwards, At Vienne , As He Was Upon The Tribunal Administering Justice, A Cock Perched Upon His Shoulder, And Afterwards Upon His Head. The Issue Corresponded To These Omens; For He Was Not Able To Keep The Empire Which Had Been Secured For Him By His Lieutenants.</a> <span class="flex">854</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="855">X. He Heard Of The Victory At Bedriacum , And The Death Of Otho, Whilst He Was Yet In Gaul, And Without The Least Hesitation, By A Single Proclamation, Disbanded All The Pretorian Cohorts, As Having, By Their Repeated Treasons, Set A Dangerous Example To The Rest Of The Army; Commanding Them To Deliver Up Their Arms To His Tribunes. A Hundred And Twenty Of Them, Under Whose Hands He Had Found Petitions Presented To Otho, For Rewards Of Their Service In The Murder Of Galba, He Besides Ordered To Be Sought Out And Punished. So Far His Conduct Deserved Approbation, And Was Such As To Afford Hope Of His Becoming An Excellent Prince, Had He Not Managed His Other Affairs In A Way More Corresponding With His Own Disposition, And His Former Manner Of Life, Than To The Imperial Dignity. For, Having Begun His March, He Rode Through Every City In His Route In A Triumphal Procession; And Sailed Down The Rivers In Ships, Fitted Out With The Greatest Elegance, And Decorated With Various Kinds Of Crowns, Amidst The Most Extravagant Entertainments. Such Was The Want Of Discipline, And The Licentiousness Both In His Family And Army, That, Not Satisfied With The Provision Every Where Made For Them At The Public Expense, They Committed Every Kind Of Robbery And Insult Upon The Inhabitants, Setting Slaves At Liberty As They Pleased; And If Any Dared To Make Resistance, They Dealt Blows And Abuse, Frequently Wounds, And Sometimes Slaughter Amongst Them. When He Reached The Plains On Which The Battles  Were Fought , Some Of Those Around Him Being Offended At The Smell Of The Carcases Which Lay Rotting Upon The Ground, He Had The Audacity To Encourage Them By A Most Detestable Remark, “That A Dead Enemy Smelt Not Amiss, Especially If He Were A Fellow-citizen.” To Qualify, However, The Offensiveness Of The Stench, He Quaffed In Public A Goblet Of Wine, And With Equal Vanity And Insolence Distributed A Large Quantity Of It Among His Troops. On His Observing A Stone With An Inscription Upon It To The Memory Of Otho, He Said, “It Was A Mausoleum Good Enough For Such A Prince.” He Also Sent The Poniard, With Which Otho Killed Himself, To The Colony Of Agrippina , To Be Dedicated To Mars. Upon The Appenine Hills He Celebrated A Bacchanalian Feast.</a> <span class="flex">855</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="856">Xi. At Last He Entered The City With Trumpets Sounding, In His General’s Cloak, And Girded With His Sword, Amidst A Display Of Standards And Banners; His Attendants Being All In The Military Habit, And The Arms Of The Soldiers Unsheathed. Acting More And More In Open Violation Of All Laws, Both Divine And Human, He Assumed The Office Of Pontifex Maximus, Upon The Day Of The Defeat At The Allia ; Ordered The Magistrates To Be Elected For Ten Years Of Office; And Made Himself Consul For Life. To Put It Out Of All Doubt What Model He Intended To Follow In His Government Of The Empire, He Made His Offerings To The Shade Of Nero In The Midst Of The Campus Martius, And With A Full Assembly Of The Public Priests Attending Him. And At A Solemn Entertainment, He Desired A Harper Who Pleased The Company Much, To Sing Something In Praise Of Domitius; And Upon His Beginning Some Songs Of Nero’s, He Started Up In Presence Of The Whole Assembly, And Could Not Refrain From Applauding Him, By Clapping His Hands.</a> <span class="flex">856</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="857">Xii. After Such A Commencement Of His Career, He Conducted  His Affairs, During The Greater Part Of His Reign, Entirely By The Advice And Direction Of The Vilest Amongst The Players And Charioteers, And Especially His Freedman Asiaticus. This Fellow Had, When Young, Been Engaged With Him In A Course Of Mutual And Unnatural Pollution, But, Being At Last Quite Tired Of The Occupation, Ran Away. His Master, Some Time After, Caught Him At Puteoli, Selling A Liquor Called Posca , And Put Him In Chains, But Soon Released Him, And Retained Him In His Former Capacity. Growing Weary, However, Of His Rough And Stubborn Temper, He Sold Him To A Strolling Fencing-master; After Which, When The Fellow Was To Have Been Brought Up To Play His Part At The Conclusion Of An Entertainment Of Gladiators, He Suddenly Carried Him Off, And At Length, Upon His Being Advanced To The Government Of A Province, Gave Him His Freedom. The First Day Of His Reign, He Presented Him With The Gold Rings At Supper, Though In The Morning, When All About Him Requested That Favour In His Behalf, He Expressed The Utmost Abhorrence Of Putting So Great A Stain Upon The Equestrian Order.</a> <span class="flex">857</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="858">Xiii. He Was Chiefly Addicted To The Vices Of Luxury And Cruelty. He Always Made Three Meals A Day, Sometimes Four: Breakfast, Dinner, And Supper, And A Drunken Revel After All. This Load Of Victuals He Could Well Enough Bear, From A Custom To Which He Had Enured Himself, Of Frequently Vomiting. For These Several Meals He Would Make Different Appointments At The Houses Of His Friends On The Same Day. None Ever Entertained Him At Less Expense Than Four Hundred Thousand Sesterces . The Most Famous Was A Set Entertainment Given Him By His Brother, At Which, It Is Said, There Were Served Up No Less Than Two Thousand Choice Fishes, And Seven Thousand Birds. Yet Even This Supper He Himself Outdid, At A Feast Which He Gave Upon The First Use Of A Dish Which Had Been Made For Him, And Which, For Its Extraordinary Size, He Called “The Shield Of Minerva.” In This Dish There Were Tossed Up Together The Livers Of Char-fish, The Brains Of Pheasants And Peacocks, With The Tongues Of Flamingos, And The Entrails Of Lampreys, Which Had Been Brought In Ships Of War As Far As  From The Carpathian Sea, And The Spanish Straits. He Was Not Only A Man Of An Insatiable Appetite, But Would Gratify It Likewise At Unseasonable Times, And With Any Garbage That Came In His Way; So That, At A Sacrifice, He Would Snatch From The Fire Flesh And Cakes, And Eat Them Upon The Spot. When He Travelled, He Did The Same At The Inns Upon The Road, Whether The Meat Was Fresh Dressed And Hot, Or What Had Been Left The Day Before, And Was Half-eaten.</a> <span class="flex">858</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="859">Xiv. He Delighted In The Infliction Of Punishments, And Even Those Which Were Capital, Without Any Distinction Of Persons Or Occasions. Several Noblemen, His School-fellows And Companions, Invited By Him To Court, He Treated With Such Flattering Caresses, As Seemed To Indicate An Affection Short Only Of Admitting Them To Share The Honours Of The Imperial Dignity; Yet He Put Them All To Death By Some Base Means Or Other. To One He Gave Poison With His Own Hand, In A Cup Of Cold Water Which He Called For In A Fever. He Scarcely Spared One Of All The Usurers, Notaries, And Publicans, Who Had Ever Demanded A Debt Of Him At Rome, Or Any Toll Or Custom Upon The Road. One Of These, While In The Very Act Of Saluting Him, He Ordered For Execution, But Immediately Sent For Him Back; Upon Which All About Him Applauding His Clemency, He Commanded Him To Be Slain In His Own Presence, Saying, “I Have A Mind To Feed My Eyes.” Two Sons Who Interceded For Their Father, He Ordered To Be Executed With Him. A Roman Knight, Upon His Being Dragged Away For Execution, And Crying Out To Him, “You Are My Heir,” He Desired To Produce His Will: And Finding That He Had Made His Freedman Joint Heir With Him, He Commanded That Both He And The Freedman Should Have Their Throats Cut. He Put To Death Some Of The Common People For Cursing Aloud The Blue Party In The Circensian Games; Supposing It To Be Done In Contempt Of Himself, And The Expectation Of A Revolution In The Government. There Were No Persons He Was More Severe Against Than Jugglers And Astrologers; And As Soon As Any One Of Them Was Informed Against, He Put Him To Death Without The Formality Of A Trial. He Was Enraged Against Them, Because, After His Proclamation By Which He Commanded All Astrologers To Quit Home, And Italy Also, Before The Calends [The First] Of October, A Bill Was Immediately Posted About The City, With The Following Words:—“take Notice:  The Chaldaeans Also Decree That Vitellius Germanicus Shall Be No More, By The Day Of The Said Calends.” He Was Even Suspected Of Being Accessary To His Mother’s Death, By Forbidding Sustenance To Be Given Her When She Was Unwell; A German Witch , Whom He Held To Be Oracular, Having Told Him, “That He Would Long Reign In Security If He Survived His Mother.” But Others Say, That Being Quite Weary Of The State Of Affairs, And Apprehensive Of The Future, She Obtained Without Difficulty A Dose Of Poison From Her Son.</a> <span class="flex">859</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="860">Xv. In The Eighth Month Of His Reign, The Troops Both In Moesia And Pannonia Revolted From Him; As Did Likewise, Of The Armies Beyond Sea, Those In Judaea And Syria, Some Of Which Swore Allegiance To Vespasian As Emperor In His Own Presence, And Others In His Absence. In Order, Therefore, To Secure The Favour And Affection Of The People, Vitellius Lavished On All Around Whatever He Had It In His Power To Bestow, Both Publicly And Privately, In The Most Extravagant Manner. He Also Levied Soldiers In The City, And Promised All Who Enlisted As Volunteers, Not Only Their Discharge After The Victory Was Gained, But All The Rewards Due To Veterans Who Had Served Their Full Time In The Wars. The Enemy Now Pressing Forward Both By Sea And Land, On One Hand He Opposed Against Them His Brother With A Fleet, The New Levies, And A Body Of Gladiators, And In Another Quarter The Troops And Generals Who Were Engaged At Bedriacum. But Being Beaten Or Betrayed In Every Direction, He Agreed With Flavius Sabinus, Vespasian’s Brother, To Abdicate, On Condition Of Having His Life Spared, And A Hundred Millions Of Sesterces Granted Him; And He Immediately, Upon The Palace-steps, Publicly Declared To A Large Body Of Soldiers There Assembled, “That He Resigned The Government, Which He Had Accepted Reluctantly;” But They All Remonstrating Against It, He Deferred The Conclusion Of The Treaty. Next Day, Early In The Morning, He Came Down To The Forum In A Very Mean Habit, And With Many Tears Repeated The  Declaration From A Writing Which He Held In His Hand; But The Soldiers And People Again Interposing, And Encouraging Him Not To Give Way, But To Rely On Their Zealous Support, He Recovered His Courage, And Forced Sabinus, With The Rest Of The Flavian Party, Who Now Thought Themselves Secure, To Retreat Into The Capitol, Where He Destroyed Them All By Setting Fire To The Temple Of Jupiter, Whilst He Beheld The Contest And The Fire From Tiberius’s House , Where He Was Feasting. Not Long After, Repenting Of What He Had Done, And Throwing The Blame Of It Upon Others, He Called A Meeting, And Swore “That Nothing Was Dearer To Him Than The Public Peace;” Which Oath He Also Obliged The Rest To Take. Then Drawing A Dagger From His Side, He Presented It First To The Consul, And, Upon His Refusing It, To The Magistrates, And Then To Every One Of The Senators; But None Of Them Being Willing To Accept It, He Went Away, As If He Meant To Lay It Up In The Temple Of Concord; But Some Crying Out To Him, “You Are Concord,” He Came Back Again, And Said That He Would Not Only Keep His Weapon, But For The Future Use The Cognomen Of Concord.</a> <span class="flex">860</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="861">Xvi. He Advised The Senate To Send Deputies, Accompanied By The Vestal Virgins, To Desire Peace, Or, At Least, Time For Consultation. The Day After, While He Was Waiting For An Answer, He Received Intelligence By A Scout, That The Enemy Was Advancing. Immediately, Therefore, Throwing Himself Into A Small Litter, Borne By Hand, With Only Two Attendants, A Baker And A Cook, He Privately Withdrew To His Father’s House, On The Aventine Hill, Intending To Escape Thence Into Campania. But A Groundless Report Being Circulated, That The Enemy Was Willing To Come To Terms, He Suffered Himself To Be Carried Back To The Palace. Finding, However, Nobody There, And Those Who Were With Him Stealing Away, He Girded Round His Waist A Belt Full Of Gold Pieces, And Then Ran Into The Porter’s Lodge, Tying The Dog Before The Door, And Piling Up Against It The Bed And Bedding.</a> <span class="flex">861</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="862">Xvii. By This Time The Forerunners Of The Enemy’s Army Had Broken Into The Palace, And Meeting With Nobody, Searched, As Was Natural, Every Corner. Being Dragged By Them Out Of His Cell, And Asked “Who He Was?” , “And If He Knew Where Vitellius Was?” He Deceived Them By A Falsehood. But At Last Being Discovered, He Begged Hard To Be Detained In Custody, Even Were It In A Prison; Pretending To Have Something To Say Which Concerned Vespasian’s Security. Nevertheless, He Was Dragged Half-naked Into The Forum, With His Hands Tied Behind Him, A Rope About His Neck, And His Clothes Torn, Amidst The Most Contemptuous Abuse, Both By Word And Deed, Along The Via Sacra; His Head Being Held Back By The Hair, In The Manner Of Condemned Criminals, And The Point Of A Sword Put Under His Chin, That He Might Hold Up His Face To Public View; Some Of The Mob, Meanwhile, Pelting Him With Dung And Mud, Whilst Others Called Him “An Incendiary And Glutton.” They Also Upbraided Him With The Defects Of His Person, For He Was Monstrously Tall, And Had A Face Usually Very Red With Hard-drinking, A Large Belly, And One Thigh Weak, Occasioned By A Chariot Running Against Him, As He Was Attending Upon Caius , While He Was Driving. At Length, Upon The Scalae Gemoniae, He Was Tormented And Put To Death In Lingering Tortures, And Then Dragged By A Hook Into The Tiber.</a> <span class="flex">862</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="863">Xviii. He Perished With His Brother And Son , In The Fifty-seventh Year Of His Age , And Verified The Prediction Of Those Who, From The Omen Which Happened To Him At Vienne, As Before Related , Foretold That He Would Be Made Prisoner By Some Man Of Gaul. For He Was Seized By Antoninus Primus, A General Of The Adverse Party, Who Was Born At Toulouse, And, When A Boy, Had The Cognomen Of Becco , Which Signifies A Cock’s Beak.</a> <span class="flex">863</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="866">I. The Empire, Which Had Been Long Thrown Into A Disturbed And Unsetted State, By The Rebellion And Violent Death Of Its Three Last Rulers, Was At Length Restored To Peace And Security By The Flavian Family, Whose Descent Was Indeed Obscure, And Which Boasted No Ancestral Honours; But The Public Had No Cause To Regret Its Elevation; Though It Is Acknowledged That Domitian Met With The Just Reward Of His Avarice And Cruelty. Titus Flavius Petro, A Townsman Of Reate , Whether A Centurion Or An Evocatus  Of Pompey’s Party In The Civil War, Is Uncertain, Fled Out Of The Battle Of Pharsalia And Went Home; Where, Having At Last Obtained His Pardon And Discharge, He Became A Collector Of The Money Raised By Public Sales In The Way Of Auction. His Son, Surnamed Sabinus, Was Never Engaged In The Military Service, Though Some Say He Was A Centurion Of The First Order, And Others, That Whilst He Held That Rank, He Was Discharged On Account Of His Bad State Of Health: This Sabinus, I Say, Was A Publican, And Received The Tax Of The Fortieth Penny In Asia. And There Were Remaining, At The Time Of The Advancement Of The Family, Several Statues, Which Had Been Erected To Him By The Cities Of That Province, With This Inscription: “To The Honest Tax-farmer.”  He Afterwards Turned Usurer Amongst The Helvetii, And There Died, Leaving Behind Him His Wife, Vespasia Pella, And Two Sons By Her; The Elder Of Whom, Sabinus, Came To Be Prefect Of The City, And The Younger, Vespasian, To Be Emperor. Polla, Descended Of A Good Family, At Nursia , Had For Her Father Vespasius Pollio, Thrice Appointed  Military Tribune, And At Last Prefect Of The Camp; And Her Brother Was A Senator Of Praetorian Dignity. There Is To This Day, About Six Miles From Nursia, On The Road To Spoletum, A Place On The Summit Of A Hill, Called Vespasiae, Where Are Several Monuments Of The Vespasii, A Sufficient Proof Of The Splendour And Antiquity Of The Family. I Will Not Deny That Some Have Pretended To Say, That Petro’s Father Was A Native Of Gallia Transpadana , Whose Employment Was To Hire Workpeople Who Used To Emigrate Every Year From The Country Of The Umbria Into That Of The Sabines, To Assist Them In Their Husbandry ; But Who Settled At Last In The Town Of Reate, And There Married. But Of This I Have Not Been Able To Discover The Least Proof, Upon The Strictest Inquiry.</a> <span class="flex">866</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="867">Ii. Vespasian Was Born In The Country Of The Sabines, Beyond Reate, In A Little Country-seat Called Phalacrine, Upon The Fifth Of The Calends Of December [27Th November], In The Evening, In The Consulship Of Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus And Caius Poppaeus Sabinus, Five Years Before The Death Of Augustus ; And Was Educated Under The Care Of Tertulla, His Grandmother By The Father’s Side, Upon An Estate Belonging To The Family, At Cosa . After His Advancement To The Empire, He Used Frequently To Visit The Place Where He Had Spent His Infancy; And The Villa Was Continued In The Same Condition, That He Might See Every Thing About Him Just As He Had Been Used To Do. And He Had So Great A Regard For The Memory Of His Grandmother, That, Upon Solemn Occasions And Festival Days, He Constantly Drank Out Of A Silver Cup Which She Had Been Accustomed To Use. After Assuming The Manly Habit, He Had A Long Time A Distaste For The Senatorian Toga, Though His Brother Had Obtained It; Nor Could He Be Persuaded By Any One But His Mother To Sue For That Badge Of Honour. She At Length Drove Him To It, More By Taunts And Reproaches, Than By Her Entreaties  And Authority, Calling Him Now And Then, By Way Of Reproach, His Brother’s Footman. He Served As Military Tribune In Thrace. When Made Quaestor, The Province Of Crete And Cyrene Fell To Him By Lot. He Was Candidate For The Aedileship, And Soon After For The Praetorship, But Met With A Repulse In The Former Case; Though At Last, With Much Difficulty, He Came In Sixth On The Poll-books. But The Office Of Praetor He Carried Upon His First Canvass, Standing Amongst The Highest At The Poll. Being Incensed Against The Senate, And Desirous To Gain, By All Possible Means, The Good Graces Of Caius , He Obtained Leave To Exhibit Extraordinary  Games For The Emperor’s Victory In Germany, And Advised Them To Increase The Punishment Of The Conspirators Against His Life, By Exposing Their Corpses Unburied. He Likewise Gave Him Thanks In That August Assembly For The Honour Of Being Admitted To His Table.</a> <span class="flex">867</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="868">Iii. Meanwhile, He Married Flavia Domitilla, Who Had Formerly Been The Mistress Of Statilius Capella, A Roman Knight Of Sabrata In Africa, Who [Domitilla] Enjoyed Latin Rights; And Was Soon After Declared Fully And Freely A Citizen Of Rome, On A Trial Before The Court Of Recovery, Brought By Her Father Flavius Liberalis, A Native Of Ferentum, But No More Than Secretary To A Quaestor. By Her He Had The Following Children: Titus, Domitian, And Domitilla. He Outlived His Wife And Daughter, And Lost Them Both Before He Became Emperor. After The Death Of His Wife, He Renewed His Union  With His Former Concubine Caenis, The Freedwoman Of Antonia, And Also Her Amanuensis, And Treated Her, Even After He Was Emperor, Almost As If She Had Been His Lawful Wife.</a> <span class="flex">868</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="873">V. After The Deaths Of Nero And Galba, Whilst Otho And Vitellius Were Contending For The Sovereignty, He Entertained Hopes Of Obtaining The Empire, With The Prospect Of Which He Had Long Before Flattered Himself, From The Following Omens. Upon An Estate Belonging To The Flavian Family, In The Neighbourhood Of Rome, There Was An Old Oak, Sacred To Mars, Which, At The Three Several Deliveries Of Vespasia, Put Out Each Time A New Branch; Evident Intimations Of The Future Fortune Of Each Child. The First Was But A Slender One, Which Quickly Withered Away; And Accordingly, The Girl That Was Born Did Not Live Long. The Second Became Vigorous, Which Portended Great Good Fortune; But The Third Grew Like A Tree. His Father, Sabinus, Encouraged By These Omens, Which Were Confirmed By The Augurs, Told His Mother, “That Her Grandson Would Be Emperor Of Rome;” At Which She Laughed Heartily, Wondering, She Said, “That Her Son Should Be In His Dotage Whilst She Continued Still In Full Possession Of Her Faculties.”</a> <span class="flex">873</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="880">Vii. Having, Therefore, Entered On A Civil War, And Sent Forward His Generals And Forces Into Italy, He Himself, In The Meantime, Passed Over To Alexandria, To Obtain Possession Of The Key Of Egypt . Here Having Entered Alone, Without Attendants, The Temple Of Serapis, To Take The Auspices Respecting The Establishment Of His Power, And Having Done His Utmost To Propitiate The Deity, Upon Turning Round, [His Freedman] Basilides  Appeared Before Him, And Seemed To Offer Him The Sacred Leaves, Chaplets, And Cakes, According To The Usage Of The Place, Although No One Had Admitted Him, And He Had Long Laboured Under A Muscular Debility, Which Would Hardly Have Allowed Him To Walk Into The Temple; Besides Which, It Was Certain That At The Very Time He Was Far Away. Immediately After This, Arrived Letters With Intelligence That Vitellius’s Troops Had Been Defeated At Cremona, And He Himself Slain At Rome. Vespasian, The New Emperor, Having Been Raised Unexpectedly From A Low Estate, Wanted Something Which Might Clothe Him With Divine Majesty And Authority. This, Likewise, Was Now Added. A Poor Man Who Was Blind, And Another Who Was Lame, Came Both Together Before Him, When He Was Seated On The Tribunal, Imploring Him To Heal Them , And Saying That They Were Admonished  Of Some Soothsayers, Several Vessels Of Ancient Workmanship Were Dug Out Of A Consecrated Place, On Which There Was An Effigy Resembling Vespasian.</a> <span class="flex">880</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="881">Viii. Returning Now To Rome, Under These Auspices, And With A Great Reputation, After Enjoying A Triumph For Victories Over The Jews, He Added Eight Consulships  To His Former One. He Likewise Assumed The Censorship, And Made It His Principal Concern, During The Whole Of His Government, First To Restore Order In The State, Which Had Been Almost Ruined, And Was In A Tottering Condition, And Then To Improve It. The Soldiers, One Part Of Them Emboldened By Victory, And The Other Smarting With The Disgrace Of Their Defeat, Had Abandoned Themselves To Every Species Of Licentiousness And Insolence. Nay, The Provinces, Too, And Free Cities, And Some Kingdoms In Alliance With Rome, Were All In A Disturbed State. He, Therefore, Disbanded Many Of Vitellius’s Soldiers, And Punished Others; And So Far Was He From Granting Any Extraordinary Favours To The Sharers Of His Success, That It Was Late Before He Paid The Gratuities Due To Them By Law. That He Might Let Slip No Opportunity Of Reforming The Discipline Of The Army, Upon A Young Man’s Coming Much Perfumed To Return Him Thanks  For Having Appointed Him To Command A Squadron Of Horse, He Turned Away His Head In Disgust, And, Giving Him This Sharp Reprimand, “I Had Rather You Had Smelt Of Garlic,” Revoked His Commission. When The Men Belonging To The Fleet, Who Travelled By Turns From Ostia And Puteoli To Rome, Petitioned For An Addition To Their Pay, Under The Name Of Shoe-money, Thinking That It Would Answer Little Purpose To Send Them Away Without A Reply, He Ordered Them For The Future To Run Barefooted; And So They Have Done Ever Since. He Deprived Of Their Liberties, Achaia, Lycia, Rhodes, Byzantium, And Samos; And Reduced Them Into The Form Of Provinces; Thrace, Also, And Cilicia, As Well As Comagene, Which Until That Time Had Been Under The Government Of Kings. He Stationed Some Legions In Cappadocia On Account Of The Frequent Inroads Of The Barbarians, And, Instead Of A Roman Knight, Appointed As Governor Of It A Man Of Consular Rank. The Ruins Of Houses Which Had Been Burnt Down Long Before, Being A Great Desight To The City, He Gave Leave To Any One Who Would, To Take Possession Of The Void Ground And Build Upon It, If The Proprietors Should Hesitate To Perform The Work Themselves. He Resolved Upon Rebuilding The Capitol, And Was The Foremost To Put His Hand To Clearing The Ground Of The Rubbish, And Removed Some Of It Upon His Own Shoulder. And He Undertook, Likewise, To Restore The Three Thousand Tables Of Brass Which Had Been Destroyed In The Fire Which Consumed The Capitol; Searching In All Quarters For Copies Of Those Curious And Ancient Records, In Which Were Contained The Decrees Of The Senate, Almost From The Building Of The City, As Well As The Acts Of The People, Relative To Alliances, Treaties, And Privileges Granted To Any Person.</a> <span class="flex">881</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="882">Ix. He Likewise Erected Several New Public Buildings, Namely, The Temple Of Peace  Near The Forum, That Of Claudius On The  Coelian Mount, Which Had Been Begun By Agrippina, But Almost Entirely Demolished By Nero ; And An Amphitheatre  In The Middle Of The City, Upon Finding That Augustus Had Projected Such A Work. He Purified The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders, Which Had Been Much Reduced By The Havoc Made Amongst Them At Several Times, And Was Fallen Into Disrepute By Neglect. Having Expelled The Most Unworthy, He Chose In Their Room The Most Honourable Persons In Italy And The Provinces. And To Let It Be Known That Those Two Orders Differed Not So Much In Privileges As In Dignity, He Declared Publicly, When Some Altercation Passed Between A Senator And A Roman Knight, “That Senators Ought Not To Be Treated With Scurrilous Language, Unless They Were The Aggressors, And Then It Was Fair And Lawful To Return It.”</a> <span class="flex">882</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="883">X. The Business Of The Courts Had Prodigiously Accumulated, Partly From Old Law-suits Which, On Account Of The Interruption That Had Been Given To The Course Of Justice, Still Remained Undecided, And Partly From The Accession Of New Suits Arising Out Of The Disorder Of The Times. He, Therefore, Chose Commissioners By Lot To Provide For The Restitution Of What Had Been Seized By Violence During The War, And Others With Extraordinary Jurisdiction To Decide Causes Belonging To The Centumviri, And Reduce Them To As Small A Number As Possible, For The Dispatch Of Which, Otherwise, The Lives Of The Litigants Could Scarcely Allow Sufficient Time.</a> <span class="flex">883</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="884">Xi. Lust And Luxury, From The Licence Which Had Long Prevailed, Had Also Grown To An Enormous Height. He, Therefore, Obtained A Decree Of The Senate, That A Woman Who Formed An Union With The Slave Of Another Person, Should Be Considered  A Bondwoman Herself; And That Usurers Should Not Be Allowed To Take Proceedings At Law For The Recovery Of Money Lent To Young Men Whilst They Lived In Their Father’s Family, Not Even After Their Fathers Were Dead.</a> <span class="flex">884</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="885">Xii. In Other Affairs, From The Beginning To The End Of His Government, He Conducted Himself With Great Moderation And Clemency. He Was So Far From Dissembling The Obscurity Of His Extraction, That He Frequently Made Mention Of It Himself. When Some Affected To Trace His Pedigree To The Founders Of Reate, And A Companion Of Hercules , Whose Monument Is Still To Be Seen On The Salarian Road, He Laughed At Them For It. And He Was So Little Fond Of External And Adventitious Ornaments, That, On The Day Of His Triumph , Being Quite Tired Of The Length And Tediousness Of The Procession, He Could Not Forbear Saying, “He Was Rightly Served, For Having In His Old Age Been So Silly As To Desire A Triumph; As If It Was Either Due To His Ancestors, Or Had Ever Been Expected By Himself.” Nor Would He For A Long Time Accept Of The Tribunitian Authority, Or The Title Of Father Of His Country. And In Regard To The Custom Of Searching Those Who Came To Salute Him, He Dropped It Even In The Time Of The Civil War.</a> <span class="flex">885</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="886">Xiii. He Bore With Great Mildness The Freedom Used By His Friends, The Satirical Allusions Of Advocates, And The Petulance Of Philosophers. Licinius Mucianus, Who Had Been Guilty Of Notorious Acts Of Lewdness, But, Presuming Upon His Great Services, Treated Him Very Rudely, He Reproved Only In Private; And When Complaining Of His Conduct To A Common Friend Of Theirs, He Concluded With These Words, “However, I Am A Man.” Salvius Liberalis, In Pleading The Cause Of A Rich Man Under Prosecution, Presuming To Say, “What Is It To Caesar, If Hipparchus Possesses A Hundred Millions Of Sesterces?” He Commended Him For It. Demetrius, The Cynic Philosopher ,  Who Had Been Sentenced To Banishment, Meeting Him On The Road, And Refusing To Rise Up Or Salute Him, Nay, Snarling At Him In Scurrilous Language, He Only Called Him A Cur.</a> <span class="flex">886</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="887">Xiv. He Was Little Disposed To Keep Up The Memory Of Affronts Or Quarrels, Nor Did He Harbour Any Resentment On Account Of Them. He Made A Very Splendid Marriage For The Daughter Of His Enemy Vitellius, And Gave Her, Besides, A Suitable Fortune And Equipage. Being In A Great Consternation After He Was Forbidden The Court In The Time Of Nero, And Asking Those About Him, What He Should Do? Or, Whither He Should Go? One Of Those Whose Office It Was To Introduce People To The Emperor, Thrusting Him Out, Bid Him Go To Morbonia . But When This Same Person Came Afterwards To Beg His Pardon, He Only Vented His Resentment In Nearly The Same Words. He Was So Far From Being Influenced By Suspicion Or Fear To Seek The Destruction Of Any One, That, When His Friends Advised Him To Beware Of Metius Pomposianus, Because It Was Commonly Believed, On His Nativity Being Cast, That He Was Destined By Fate To The Empire, He Made Him Consul, Promising For Him, That He Would Not Forget The Benefit Conferred.</a> <span class="flex">887</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="888">Xv. It Will Scarcely Be Found, That So Much As One Innocent Person Suffered In His Reign, Unless In His Absence, And Without His Knowledge, Or, At Least, Contrary To His Inclination, And When He Was Imposed Upon. Although Helvidius Priscus  Was The Only Man Who Presumed To Salute Him On His Return From Syria By His Private Name Of Vespasian, And, When He Came To Be Praetor, Omitted Any Mark Of Honour To Him, Or Even Any Mention Of Him In His Edicts, Yet He Was Not Angry, Until Helvidius Proceeded To Inveigh Against Him With The Most Scurrilous Language.  Though He Did Indeed Banish Him, And Afterwards Ordered Him To Be Put To Death, Yet He Would Gladly Have Saved Him Notwithstanding, And Accordingly Dispatched Messengers To Fetch Back The Executioners; And He Would Have Saved Him, Had He Not Been Deceived By A False Account Brought, That He Had Already Perished. He Never Rejoiced At The Death Of Any Man; Nay He Would Shed Tears, And Sigh, At The Just Punishment Of The Guilty.</a> <span class="flex">888</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="889">Xvi. The Only Thing Deservedly Blameable In His Character Was His Love Of Money. For Not Satisfied With Reviving The Imposts Which Had Been Repealed In The Time Of Galba, He Imposed New And Onerous Taxes, Augmented The Tribute Of The Provinces, And Doubled That Of Some Of Them. He Likewise Openly Engaged In A Traffic, Which Is Discreditable  Even To A Private Individual, Buying Great Quantities Of Goods, For The Purpose Of Retailing Them Again To Advantage. Nay, He Made No Scruple Of Selling The Great Offices Of The State To Candidates, And Pardons To Persons Under Prosecution, Whether They Were Innocent Or Guilty. It Is Believed, That He Advanced All The Most Rapacious Amongst The Procurators To Higher Offices, With The View Of Squeezing Them After They Had Acquired Great Wealth. He Was Commonly Said, “To Have Used Them As Sponges,” Because It Was His Practice, As We May Say, To Wet Them When Dry, And Squeeze Them When Wet. It Is Said That He Was Naturally Extremely Covetous, And Was Upbraided With It By An Old Herdsman Of His, Who, Upon The Emperor’s Refusing To Enfranchise Him Gratis, Which On His Advancement He Humbly Petitioned For, Cried Out, “That The Fox Changed His Hair, But Not His Nature.” On The Other Hand, Some Are Of Opinion, That He Was Urged To His Rapacious Proceedings By Necessity, And The Extreme Poverty Of The Treasury And Exchequer, Of Which He Took Public Notice In The Beginning Of His Reign; Declaring That “No Less Than Four Hundred Thousand Millions Of Sesterces Were Wanting To Carry On The Government.” This Is The More Likely To Be True, Because He Applied To The Best Purposes What He Procured By Bad Means.</a> <span class="flex">889</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="890">Xvii. His Liberality, However, To All Ranks Of People, Was Excessive. He Made Up To Several Senators The Estate Required  By Law To Qualify Them For That Dignity; Relieving Likewise Such Men Of Consular Rank As Were Poor, With A Yearly Allowance Of Five Hundred Thousand Sesterces ; And Rebuilt, In A Better Manner Than Before, Several Cities In Different Parts Of The Empire, Which Had Been Damaged By Earthquakes Or Fires.</a> <span class="flex">890</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="891">Xviii. He Was A Great Encourager Of Learning And The Liberal Arts. He First Granted To The Latin And Greek Professors Of Rhetoric The Yearly Stipend Of A Hundred Thousand Sesterces  Each Out Of The Exchequer. He Also Bought The Freedom Of Superior Poets And Artists , And Gave A Noble Gratuity To The Restorer Of The Coan Of Venus , And To Another Artist Who Repaired The Colossus . Some One Offering To Convey Some Immense Columns Into The Capitol At A Small Expense By A Mechanical Contrivance, He Rewarded Him Very Handsomely For His Invention, But Would Not Accept His Service, Saying, “Suffer Me To Find Maintenance For The Poor People.”</a> <span class="flex">891</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="892">Xix. In The Games Celebrated When The Stage-scenery Of  The Theatre Of Marcellus  Was Repaired, He Restored The Old Musical Entertainments. He Gave Apollinaris, The Tragedian, Four Hundred Thousand Sesterces, And To Terpinus And Diodorus, The Harpers, Two Hundred Thousand; To Some A Hundred Thousand; And The Least He Gave To Any Of The Performers Was Forty Thousand, Besides Many Golden Crowns. He Entertained Company Constantly At His Table, And Often In Great State And Very Sumptuously, In Order To Promote Trade. As In The Saturnalia He Made Presents To The Men Which They Were To Carry Away With Them, So Did He To The Women Upon The Calends Of March ; Notwithstanding Which, He Could Not Wipe Off The Disrepute Of His Former Stinginess. The Alexandrians Called Him Constantly Cybiosactes; A Name Which Had Been Given To One Of Their Kings Who Was Sordidly Avaricious. Nay, At His Funeral, Favo, The Principal Mimic, Personating Him, And Imitating, As Actors Do, Both His Manner Of Speaking And His Gestures, Asked Aloud Of The Procurators, “How Much His Funeral And The Procession Would Cost?” And Being Answered “Ten Millions Of Sesterces,” He Cried Out, “Give Him But A Hundred Thousand Sesterces, And They Might Throw His Body Into The Tiber, If They Would.”</a> <span class="flex">892</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="893">Xx. He Was Broad-set, Strong-limbed, And His Features Gave The Idea Of A Man In The Act Of Straining Himself. In Consequence, One Of The City Wits, Upon The Emperor’s Desiring Him “To Say Something Droll Respecting Himself,” Facetiously Answered, “I Will, When You Have Done Relieving Your Bowels.”  He Enjoyed A Good State Of Health, Though He Used No Other Means To Preserve It, Than Repeated Friction, As Much  As He Could Bear, On His Neck And Other Parts Of His Body, In The Tennis-court Attached To The Baths, Besides Fasting One Day In Every Month.</a> <span class="flex">893</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="894">Xxi. His Method Of Life Was Commonly This. After He Became Emperor, He Used To Rise Very Early, Often Before Daybreak. Having Read Over His Letters, And The Briefs Of All The Departments Of The Government Offices; He Admitted His Friends; And While They Were Paying Him Their Compliments, He Would Put On His Own Shoes, And Dress Himself With His Own Hands. Then, After The Dispatch Of Such Business As Was Brought Before Him, He Rode Out, And Afterwards Retired To Repose, Lying On His Couch With One Of His Mistresses, Of Whom He Kept Several After The Death Of Caenis . Coming Out Of His Private Apartments, He Passed To The Bath, And Then Entered The Supper-room. They Say That He Was Never More Good-humoured And Indulgent Than At That Time: And Therefore His Attendants Always Seized That Opportunity, When They Had Any Favour To Ask.</a> <span class="flex">894</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="895">Xxii. At Supper, And, Indeed, At Other Times, He Was Extremely Free And Jocose. For He Had Humour, But Of A Low Kind, And He Would Sometimes Use Indecent Language, Such As Is Addressed To Young Girls About To Be Married. Yet There Are Some Things Related Of Him Not Void Of Ingenious Pleasantry; Amongst Which Are The Following. Being Once Reminded By Mestrius Florus, That Plaustra Was A More Proper Expression Than Plostra, He The Next Day Saluted Him By The Name Of Flaurus . A Certain Lady Pretending To Be Desperately Enamoured Of Him, He Was Prevailed Upon To Admit Her To His Bed; And After He Had Gratified Her Desires, He Gave Her  Four Hundred  Thousand Sesterces. When His Steward Desired To Know How He Would Have The Sum Entered In His Accounts, He Replied, “For Vespasian’s Being Seduced.”</a> <span class="flex">895</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="896">Xxiii.

In His Ninth Consulship, Being Seized, While In Campania, With A Slight Indisposition, And Immediately Returning To The City, He Soon Afterwards Went Thence To Cutiliae , And His Estates In The Country About Reate, Where He Used Constantly To Spend The Summer. Here, Though His Disorder Much Increased, And He Injured His Bowels By Too Free Use Of The Cold Waters, He Nevertheless Attended To The Dispatch Of Business, And Even Gave Audience To Ambassadors In Bed. At Last, Being Taken Ill Of A Diarrhoea, To Such A Degree That He Was Ready To Faint, He Cried Out, “An Emperor Ought To Die Standing Upright.” In Endeavouring To Rise, He Died In The Hands Of Those Who Were Helping Him Up, Upon The Eighth Of The Calends Of July [24Th June] , Being Sixty-nine Years, One Month, And Seven Days Old.</a> <span class="flex">900</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="901">Xxv. All Are Agreed That He Had Such Confidence In The Calculations On His Own Nativity And That Of His Sons, That, After Several Conspiracies Against Him, He Told The Senate, That Either His Sons Would Succeed Him, Or Nobody. It Is Said Likewise, That He Once Saw In A Dream A Balance In The Middle Of The Porch Of The Palatine House Exactly Poised; In One  Scale Of Which Stood Claudius And Nero, In The Other, Himself And His Sons. The Event Corresponded To The Symbol; For The Reigns Of The Two Parties Were Precisely Of The Same Duration.</a> <span class="flex">901</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="907">C. Valerius Flaccus Wrote A Poem In Eight Books, On The Expedition Of The Argonauts; A Subject Which, Next To The Wars Of Thebes And Troy, Was In Ancient Times The Most Celebrated. Of The Life Of This Author, Biographers Have Transmitted No Particulars; But We May Place His Birth In The Reign Of Tiberius, Before All The Writers Who Flourished In The Augustan Age Were Extinct. He Enjoyed The Rays Of The Setting Sun Which Had Illumined That Glorious Period, And He Discovers The Efforts Of An Ambition To Recall Its Meridian Splendour. As The Poem Was Left  Incomplete By The Death Of The Author, We Can Only Judge Imperfectly Of The Conduct And General Consistency Of The Fable: But The Most Difficult Part Having Been Executed, Without Any Room For The Censure Of Candid Criticism, We May Presume That The Sequel Would Have Been Finished With An Equal Claim To Indulgence, If Not To Applause. The Traditional Anecdotes Relative To The Argonautic Expedition Are Introduced With Propriety, And Embellished With The Graces Of Poetical Fiction. In Describing Scenes Of Tenderness, This Author Is Happily Pathetic, And In The Heat Of Combat, Proportionably Animated. His Similes Present The Imagination With Beautiful Imagery, And Not Only Illustrate, But Give Additional Force To The Subject. We Find In Flaccus A Few Expressions Not Countenanced By The Authority Of The Most Celebrated Latin Writers. His Language, However, In General, Is Pure; But His Words Are Perhaps Not Always The Best That Might Have Been Chosen. The Versification Is Elevated, Though Not Uniformly Harmonious; And There Pervades The Whole Poem An Epic Dignity, Which Renders It Superior To The Production Ascribed To Orpheus, Or To That Of Apollonius, On The Same Subject.</a> <span class="flex">907</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="908">Titus Flavius Vespasianus Augustus.</a> <span class="flex">908</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="909">I. Titus, Who Had The Same Cognomen With His Father, Was The Darling And Delight Of Mankind; So Much Did The Natural Genius, Address, Or Good Fortune He Possessed Tend To Conciliate The Favour Of All. This Was, Indeed, Extremely Difficult, After He Became Emperor, As Before That Time, And Even During The Reign Of His Father, He Lay Under Public Odium And Censure. He Was Born Upon The Third Of The Calends Of January, [30Th Dec.] In The Year Remarkable For The Death Of Caius  , Near The Septizonium , In A Mean House, And A Very Small And Dark Room, Which Still Exists, And Is Shown To The Curious.</a> <span class="flex">909</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="910">Ii. He Was Educated In The Palace With Britannicus, And Instructed In The Same Branches Of Learning, And Under The Same Masters. During This Time, They Say, That A Physiognomist Being Introduced By Narcissus, The Freedman Of Claudius, To Examine The Features Of Britannicus , Positively Affirmed That He Would Never Become Emperor, But That Titus, Who Stood By, Would. They Were So Familiar, That Titus Being Next Him At Table, Is Thought To Have Tasted Of The Fatal Potion Which Put An End To Britannicus’s Life, And To Have Contracted From It A Distemper Which Hung About Him A Long Time. In Remembrance Of All These Circumstances, He Afterwards Erected A Golden Statue Of Him In The Palatium, And Dedicated To Him An Equestrian Statue Of Ivory; Attending It In The Circensian Procession, In Which It Is Still Carried To This Day.</a> <span class="flex">910</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="913">Iv. He Filled With Distinction The Rank Of A Military Tribune Both In Germany And Britain, In Which He Conducted Himself With The Utmost Activity, And No Less Modesty And Reputation; As Appears Evident From The Great Number Of Statues, With Honourable Inscriptions, Erected To Him In Various Parts Of Both Those Provinces. After Serving In The Wars, He Frequented The Courts Of Law, But With Less Assiduity Than Applause. About The Same Time, He Married Arricidia, The Daughter Of Tertullus, Who Was Only A Knight, But Had Formerly Been Prefect Of The Pretorian Guards. After Her Decease, He Married Marcia Furnilla, Of A Very Noble Family, But Afterwards Divorced Her, Taking From Her The Daughter He Had By Her. Upon The Expiration Of His Quaestorship, He Was Raised To The Rank Of Commander Of A Legion , And Took The Two Strong Cities Of Tarichaea And Gamala, In Judaea; And Having His Horse Killed Under Him In A Battle, He Mounted Another, Whose Rider He Had Encountered And Slain.</a> <span class="flex">913</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="914">V. Soon Afterwards, When Galba Came To Be Emperor, He Was Sent To Congratulate Him, And Turned The Eyes Of All People Upon Himself, Wherever He Came; It Being The General Opinion Amongst Them, That The Emperor Had Sent For Him With A Design To Adopt Him For His Son. But Finding All Things Again In Confusion, He Turned Back Upon The Road; And Going To Consult  The Oracle Of Venus At Paphos About His Voyage, He Received Assurances Of Obtaining The Empire For Himself. These Hopes Were Speedily Strengthened, And Being Left To Finish The Reduction Of Judaea, In The Final Assault Of Jerusalem, He Slew Seven Of Its Defenders, With The Like Number Of Arrows, And Took It Upon His Daughter’s Birth-day . So Great Was The Joy And Attachment Of The Soldiers, That, In Their Congratulations, They Unanimously Saluted Him By The Title Of Emperor ; And, Upon His Quitting The Province Soon Afterwards, Would Needs Have Detained Him, Earnestly Begging Him, And That Not Without Threats, “Either To Stay, Or Take Them All With Him.” This Occurrence Gave Rise To The Suspicion Of His Being Engaged In A Design To Rebel Against His Father, And Claim For Himself The Government Of The East; And The Suspicion Increased, When, On His Way To Alexandria, He Wore A Diadem At The Consecration Of The Ox Apis At Memphis; And, Though He Did It Only In Compliance With An Ancient Religious Usage Of The Country, Yet There Was Some Who Put A Bad Construction Upon It. Making, Therefore, What Haste He Could Into Italy, He Arrived First At Rhegium, And Sailing Thence In A Merchant Ship To Puteoli, Went To Rome With All Possible Expedition. Presenting Himself Unexpectedly To His Father, He Said, By Way Of Contradicting The Strange Reports Raised Concerning Him, “I Am Come, Father, I Am Come.”</a> <span class="flex">914</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="915">Vi. From That Time He Constantly Acted As Colleague With His Father, And, Indeed, As Regent Of The Empire. He Triumphed   With His Father, Bore Jointly With Him The Office Of Censor , And Was, Besides, His Colleague Not Only In The Tribunitian Authority , But In Seven Consulships . Taking Upon Himself The Care And Inspection Of All Offices, He Dictated Letters, Wrote Proclamations In His Father’s Name, And Pronounced His Speeches In The Senate In Place Of The Quaestor. He Likewise Assumed The Command Of The Pretorian Guards, Although No One But A Roman Knight Had Ever Before Been Their Prefect. In This He Conducted Himself With Great Haughtiness And Violence, Taking Off Without Scruple Or Delay All Those He Had Most Reason To Suspect, After He Had Secretly Sent His Emissaries Into The Theatres And Camp, To Demand, As If By General Consent, That The Suspected Persons Should Be Delivered Up To Punishment. Among These, He Invited To Supper A. Caecina, A Man Of Consular Rank, Whom He Ordered To Be Stabbed At His Departure, Immediately After He Had Gone Out Of The Room. To This Act, Indeed, He Was Provoked By An Imminent Danger; For He Had Discovered A Writing Under The Hand Of Caecina, Containing An Account Of A Plot Hatched Among The Soldiers. By These Acts, Though He Provided For His Future Security, Yet For The Present He So Much Incurred The Hatred Of The People, That Scarcely Ever Any One Came To The Empire With A More Odious Character, Or More Universally Disliked.</a> <span class="flex">915</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="916">Vii. Besides His Cruelty, He Lay Under The Suspicion Of Giving  And If Ever Man Refrained From Injustice, He Did; Nay, He Would Not Accept Of The Allowable And Customary Offerings. Yet, In Munificence, He Was Inferior To None Of The Princes Before Him. Having Dedicated His Amphitheatre , And Built Some Warm Baths  Close By It With Great Expedition, He Entertained The People With Most Magnificent Spectacles. He Likewise Exhibited A Naval Fight In The Old Naumachia, Besides A Combat Of Gladiators; And In One Day Brought Into The Theatre Five Thousand Wild Beasts Of All Kinds.</a> <span class="flex">916</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="921">Ix. Having Declared That He Accepted The Office Of Pontifex Maximus For The Purpose Of Preserving His Hands Undefiled, He Faithfully Adhered To His Promise. For After That Time He Was Neither Directly Nor Indirectly Concerned In The Death Of Any Person, Though He Sometimes Was Justly Irritated. He Swore “That He Would Perish Himself, Rather Than Prove The Destruction Of Any Man.” Two Men Of Patrician Rank Being Convicted Of Aspiring To The Empire, He Only Advised Them To Desist, Saying, “That The Sovereign Power Was Disposed Of By Fate,” And Promised Them, That If There Was Any Thing Else They Desired Of Him, He Would Grant It. He Also Immediately Sent Messengers To The Mother Of One Of Them, Who Was At A Great Distance, And In Deep Anxiety About Her Son, To Assure Her Of His Safety. Nay, He Not Only Invited Them To Sup With  Him, But Next Day, At A Show Of Gladiators, Purposely Placed Them Close By Him; And Handed To Them The Arms Of The Combatants For His Inspection. It Is Said Likewise, That Having Had Their Nativities Cast, He Assured Them, “That A Great Calamity Was Impending On Both Of Them, But From Another Hand, And Not From His.” Though His Brother Was Continually Plotting Against Him, Almost Openly Stirring Up The Armies To Rebellion, And Contriving To Get Away, Yet He Could Not Endure To Put Him To Death, Or To Banish Him From His Presence; Nor Did He Treat Him With Less Respect Than Before. But From His First Accession To The Empire, He Constantly Declared Him His Partner In It, And That He Should Be His Successor; Begging Of Him Sometimes In Private, With Tears In His Eyes, “To Return The Affection He Had For Him.”</a> <span class="flex">921</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="922">X. Amidst All These Favourable Circumstances, He Was Cut Off By An Untimely Death, More To The Loss Of Mankind Than Himself. At The Close Of The Public Spectacles, He Wept Bitterly In The Presence Of The People, And Then Retired Into The Sabine Country , Rather Melancholy, Because A Victim Had Made Its Escape While He Was Sacrificing, And Loud Thunder Had Been Heard While The Atmosphere Was Serene. At The First Resting-place On The Road, He Was Seized With A Fever, And Being Carried Forward In A Litter, They Say That He Drew Back The Curtains, And Looked Up To Heaven, Complaining Heavily, “That His Life Was Taken From Him, Though He Had Done Nothing To Deserve It; For There Was No Action Of His That He Had Occasion To Repent Of, But One.” What That Was, He Neither Disclosed Himself, Nor Is It Easy For Us To Conjecture. Some Imagine That He Alluded To The Connection Which He Had Formerly Had With His Brother’s Wife. But Domitia Solemnly Denied It On Oath; Which She Would Never Have Done, Had There Been Any Truth In The Report; Nay, She Would Certainly Have Gloried In It, As She Was Forward Enough To Boast Of All Her Scandalous Intrigues.</a> <span class="flex">922</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="923">Xi. He Died In The Same Villa Where His Father Had Died  Before Him, Upon The Ides Of September [The 13Th Of September]; Two Years, Two Months, And Twenty Days After He Had Succeeded His Father; And In The One-and-fortieth Year Of His Age . As Soon As The News Of His Death Was Published, All People Mourned For Him, As For The Loss Of Some Near Relative. The Senate Assembled In Haste, Before They Could Be Summoned By Proclamation, And Locking The Doors Of Their House At First, But Afterwards Opening Them, Gave Him Such Thanks, And Heaped Upon Him Such Praises, Now He Was Dead, As They Never Had Done Whilst He Was Alive And Present Amongst Them.</a> <span class="flex">923</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="937">Titus Flavius Domitianus.</a> <span class="flex">937</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="938">I. Domitian Was Born Upon The Ninth Of The Calends Of November [24Th October]  , When His Father Was Consul Elect,  Power So Licentiously, That Even Then He Plainly Discovered What Sort Of Prince He Was Likely To Prove. Not To Go Into Details, After He Had Made Free With The Wives Of Many Men Of Distinction, He Took Domitia Longina From Her Husband, Aelias Lamia, And Married Her; And In One Day Disposed Of Above Twenty Offices In The City And The Provinces; Upon Which Vespasian Said Several Times, “He Wondered He Did Not Send Him A Successor Too.”</a> <span class="flex">938</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="939">Ii. He Likewise Designed An Expedition Into Gaul And Germany , Without The Least Necessity For It, And Contrary To The Advice Of All His Father’s Friends; And This He Did Only With The View Of Equalling His Brother In Military Achievements And Glory. But For This He Was Severely Reprimanded, And That He Might The More Effectually Be Reminded Of His Age And Position, Was Made To Live With His Father, And His Litter Had To Follow His Father’s And Brother’s Carriage, As Often As They Went Abroad; But He Attended Them In Their Triumph For The Conquest Of Judaea , Mounted On A White Horse. Of The Six Consulships Which He Held, Only One Was Ordinary; And That He Obtained By The Cession And Interest Of His Brother. He Greatly Affected A Modest Behaviour, And, Above All, A Taste For Poetry; Insomuch, That He Rehearsed His Performances In Public, Though It Was An Art He Had Formerly Little Cultivated, And Which He Afterwards Despised And Abandoned. Devoted, However, As He Was At This Time To Poetical Pursuits, Yet When Vologesus, King Of The Parthians, Desired Succours Against The Alani, With One Of Vespasian’s Sons To Command Them, He Laboured Hard To Procure For Himself That Appointment. But The Scheme Proving Abortive, He Endeavoured By Presents And Promises To Engage Other Kings Of The East To Make A Similar Request. After His Father’s Death, He Was For Some Time In Doubt, Whether He Should Not Offer The Soldiers A Donative Double To That Of His Brother, And Made No Scruple Of Saying Frequently, “That He Had Been Left His Partner In The Empire, But That His Father’s Will Had Been Fraudulently Set Aside.” From That Time Forward, He Was Constantly Engaged In Plots Against His Brother, Both Publicly And Privately; Until, Falling Dangerously Ill, He Ordered All His Attendants To  Leave Him, Under Pretence Of His Being Dead, Before He Really Was So; And, At His Decease, Paid Him No Other Honour Than That Of Enrolling Him Amongst The Gods; And He Often, Both In Speeches And Edicts, Carped At His Memory By Sneers And Insinuations.</a> <span class="flex">939</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="940">Iii. In The Beginning Of His Reign, He Used To Spend Daily An Hour By Himself In Private, During Which Time He Did Nothing Else But Catch Flies, And Stick Them Through The Body With A Sharp Pin. When Some One Therefore Inquired, “Whether Any One Was With The Emperor,” It Was Significantly Answered By Vibius Crispus, “Not So Much As A Fly.” Soon After His Advancement, His Wife Domitia, By Whom He Had A Son In His Second Consulship, And Whom The Year Following He Complimented With The Title Of Augusta, Being Desperately In Love With Paris, The Actor, He Put Her Away; But Within A Short Time Afterwards, Being Unable To Bear The Separation, He Took Her Again, Under Pretence Of Complying With The People’s Importunity. During Some Time, There Was In His Administration A Strange Mixture Of Virtue And Vice, Until At Last His Virtues Themselves Degenerated Into Vices; Being, As We May Reasonably Conjecture Concerning His Character, Inclined To Avarice Through Want, And To Cruelty Through Fear.</a> <span class="flex">940</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="941">Iv. He Frequently Entertained The People With Most Magnificent And Costly Shows, Not Only In The Amphitheatre, But The Circus; Where, Besides The Usual Races With Chariots Drawn By Two Or Four Horses A-breast, He Exhibited The Representation Of An Engagement Between Both Horse And Foot, And A Sea-fight In The Amphitheatre. The People Were Also Entertained With The Chase Of Wild Beasts And The Combat Of Gladiators, Even In The Night-time, By Torch-light. Nor Did Men Only Fight In These Spectacles, But Women Also. He Constantly Attended At The Games Given By The Quaestors, Which Had Been Disused For Some Time, But Were Revived By Him; And Upon Those Occasions, Always Gave The People The Liberty Of Demanding Two Pair Of Gladiators Out Of His Own School, Who Appeared Last In Court Uniforms. Whenever He Attended The Shows Of Gladiators, There Stood At His Feet A Little Boy Dressed In Scarlet, With A Prodigiously Small Head, With Whom He Used To Talk Very Much, And Sometimes Seriously. We Are Assured, That He Was  To The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders, And Small Baskets To The Common People, And Encouraged Them To Eat By Setting Them The Example. The Day After, He Scattered Among The People A Variety Of Cakes And Other Delicacies To Be Scrambled For; And On The Greater Part Of Them Falling Amidst The Seats Of The Crowd, He Ordered Five Hundred Tickets To Be Thrown Into Each Range Of Benches Belonging To The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders.</a> <span class="flex">941</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="942">V. He Rebuilt Many Noble Edifices Which Had Been Destroyed By Fire, And Amongst Them The Capitol, Which Had Been Burnt Down A Second Time ; But All The Inscriptions Were In His Own Name, Without The Least Mention Of The Original Founders. He Likewise Erected A New Temple In The Capitol To Jupiter Custos, And A Forum, Which Is Now Called Nerva’s , As Also The Temple Of The Flavian Family , A Stadium , An Odeum , And A Naumachia ; Out Of The Stone Dug From Which, The Sides Of The Circus Maximus, Which Had Been Burnt Down, Were Rebuilt.</a> <span class="flex">942</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="943">Vi. He Undertook Several Expeditions, Some From Choice, And Some From Necessity. That Against The Catti  Was Unprovoked, But That Against The Sarmatians Was Necessary; An Entire Legion, With Its Commander, Having Been Cut Off By Them. He Sent Two Expeditions Against The Dacians; The First Upon The Defeat Of Oppius Sabinus, A Man Of Consular Rank; And  The Other, Upon That Of Cornelius Fuscus, Prefect Of The Pretorian Cohorts, To Whom He Had Entrusted The Conduct Of That War. After Several Battles With The Catti And Daci, He Celebrated A Double Triumph. But For His Successes Against The Sarmatians, He Only Bore In Procession The Laurel Crown To Jupiter Capitolinus. The Civil War, Begun By Lucius Antonius, Governor Of Upper Germany, He Quelled, Without Being Obliged To Be Personally Present At It, With Remarkable Good Fortune. For, At The Very Moment Of Joining Battle, The Rhine Suddenly Thawing, The Troops Of The Barbarians Which Were Ready To Join L. Antonius, Were Prevented From Crossing The River. Of This Victory He Had Notice By Some Presages, Before The Messengers Who Brought The News Of It Arrived. For Upon The Very Day The Battle Was Fought, A Splendid Eagle Spread Its Wings Round His Statue At Rome, Making Most Joyful Cries. And Shortly After, A Rumour Became Common, That Antonius Was Slain; Nay, Many Positively Affirmed, That They Saw His Head Brought To The City.</a> <span class="flex">943</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="944">Vii. He Made Many Innovations In Common Practices. He Abolished The Sportula , And Revived The Old Practice Of Regular Suppers. To The Four Former Parties In The Circensian Games, He Added Two New, Who Were Gold And Scarlet. He Prohibited The Players From Acting In The Theatre, But Permitted Them The Practice Of Their Art In Private Houses. He Forbad The Castration Of Males; And Reduced The Price Of The Eunuchs Who Were Still Left In The Hands Of The Dealers In Slaves. On The Occasion Of A Great Abundance Of Wine, Accompanied By A Scarcity Of Corn, Supposing That The Tillage Of The Ground Was Neglected For The Sake Of Attending Too Much To The Cultivation Of Vineyards, He Published A Proclamation Forbidding The Planting Of Any New Vines In Italy, And Ordering The Vines In The Provinces To Be Cut Down, Nowhere Permitting More Than One Half Of Them To Remain . But He Did Not Persist In The Execution Of This Project. Some Of The Greatest Offices He Conferred Upon His Freedmen And Soldiers. He Forbad Two Legions To Be Quartered In The Same Camp, And More Than A Thousand Sesterces To Be Deposited By Any Soldier With The Standards; Because It Was Thought That Lucius Antonius Had Been Encouraged In His Late Project By The Large Sum Deposited In The Military Chest By The Two Legions Which He Had In The Same Winter-quarters. He Made An Addition To The Soldiers’ Pay, Of Three Gold Pieces A Year.</a> <span class="flex">944</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="945">Viii. In The Administration Of Justice He Was Diligent And Assiduous; And Frequently Sat In The Forum Out Of Course, To Cancel The Judgments Of The Court Of The One Hundred, Which Had Been Procured Through Favour, Or Interest. He Occasionally Cautioned The Judges Of The Court Of Recovery To Beware Of Being Too Ready To Admit Claims For Freedom Brought Before Them. He Set A Mark Of Infamy Upon Judges Who Were Convicted Of Taking Bribes, As Well As Upon Their Assessors. He Likewise Instigated The Tribunes Of The People To Prosecute A Corrupt Aedile For Extortion, And To Desire The Senate To Appoint Judges For His Trial. He Likewise Took Such Effectual Care In Punishing Magistrates Of The City, And Governors Of Provinces, Guilty Of Malversation, That They Never Were At Any Time More Moderate Or More Just. Most Of These, Since His Reign, We Have Seen Prosecuted For Crimes Of Various Kinds. Having Taken Upon Himself The Reformation Of The Public Manners, He Restrained The Licence Of The Populace In Sitting Promiscuously With The Knights In The Theatre. Scandalous Libels, Published To Defame Persons Of Rank, Of Either Sex, He Suppressed, And Inflicted Upon Their Authors A Mark Of Infamy. He Expelled A Man Of Quaestorian Rank From The Senate, For Practising Mimicry And Dancing. He Debarred Infamous Women The Use Of Litters; As Also The Right Of Receiving Legacies, Or Inheriting Estates. He Struck Out Of The List Of Judges A Roman Knight For Taking Again His Wife Whom He Had Divorced And Prosecuted For Adultery. He Condemned Several Men Of The Senatorian And Equestrian Orders, Upon The Scantinian Law . The Lewdness Of The Vestal Virgins, Which Had Been Overlooked By His Father And Brother, He Punished Severely, But In Different Ways; Viz. Offences Committed Before His Reign, With Death, And Those Since Its Commencement, According To Ancient Custom. For To The Two Sisters Called Ocellatae, He Gave Liberty To Choose The Mode Of Death Which They Preferred, And Banished  Their Paramours. But Cornelia, The President Of The Vestals, Who Had Formerly Been Acquitted Upon A Charge Of Incontinence, Being A Long Time After Again Prosecuted And Condemned, He Ordered To Be Buried Alive; And Her Gallants To Be Whipped To Death With Rods In The Comitium; Excepting Only A Man Of Praetorian Rank, To Whom, Because He Confessed The Fact, While The Case Was Dubious, And It Was Not Established Against Him, Though The Witnesses Had Been Put To The Torture, He Granted The Favour Of Banishment. And To Preserve Pure And Undefiled The Reverence Due To The Gods, He Ordered The Soldiers To Demolish A Tomb, Which One Of His Freedmen Had Erected For His Son Out Of The Stones Designed For The Temple Of Jupiter Capitolinus, And To Sink In The Sea The Bones And Relics Buried In It.</a> <span class="flex">945</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="946">Ix. Upon His First Succeeding To Power, He Felt Such An Abhorrence For The Shedding Of Blood, That, Before His Father’s Arrival In Rome, Calling To Mind The Verse Of Virgil,</a> <span class="flex">946</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="949">X. But He Did Not Long Persevere In This Course Of Clemency And Justice, Although He Sooner Fell Into Cruelty Than Into Avarice. He Put To Death A Scholar Of Paris, The Pantomimic , Though A Minor, And Then Sick, Only Because, Both In Person And The Practice Of His Art, He Resembled His Master; As He Did Likewise Hermogenes Of Tarsus For Some Oblique Reflections In His History; Crucifying, Besides, The Scribes Who Had Copied The Work. One Who Was Master Of A Band Of Gladiators, Happening To Say, “That A Thrax Was A Match For A Marmillo , But Not So For The Exhibitor Of The Games”, He Ordered Him To Be Dragged From The Benches Into The Arena, And Exposed To The Dogs, With This Label Upon Him, “A Parmularian  Guilty Of Talking Impiously.” He Put To Death Many Senators, And Amongst Them Several Men Of Consular Rank. In This Number Were, Civica Cerealis, When He Was Proconsul In Africa, Salvidienus Orfitus, And Acilius Glabrio In Exile, Under The Pretence Of Their Planning To Revolt Against Him. The Rest He Punished Upon Very Trivial Occasions; As Aelius Lamia For Some Jocular Expressions, Which Were Of Old Date, And Perfectly Harmless; Because, Upon His Commending His Voice After He Had Taken His Wife From Him , He Replied, “Alas! I Hold My Tongue.” And When Titus Advised Him To Take Another Wife, He Answered Him Thus: “What! Have You A Mind To Marry?” Salvius Cocceianus Was Condemned To Death For Keeping The Birth-day Of His Uncle Otho, The Emperor: Metius Pomposianus, Because He Was Commonly Reported To Have An Imperial Nativity , And To Carry About With  Him A Map Of The World Upon Vellum, With The Speeches Of Kings And Generals Extracted Out Of Titus Livius; And For Giving His Slaves The Names Of Mago And Hannibal; Sallustius Lucullus, Lieutenant In Britain, For Suffering Some Lances Of A New Invention To Be Called “Lucullean;” And Junius Rusticus, For Publishing A Treatise In Praise Of Paetus Thrasea And Helvidius Priscus, And Calling Them Both “Most Upright Men.” Upon This Occasion, He Likewise Banished All The Philosophers From The City And Italy. He Put To Death The Younger Helvidius, For Writing A Farce, In Which, Under The Character Of Paris And Oenone, He Reflected Upon His Having Divorced His Wife; And Also Flavius Sabinus, One Of His Cousins, Because, Upon His Being Chosen At The Consular Election To That Office, The Public Crier Had, By A Blunder, Proclaimed Him To The People Not Consul, But Emperor. Becoming Still More Savage After His Success In The Civil War, He Employed The Utmost Industry To Discover Those Of The Adverse Party Who Absconded: Many Of Them He Racked With A New-invented Torture, Inserting Fire Through Their Private Parts; And From Some He Cut Off Their Hands. It Is Certain, That Only Two Of Any Note Were Pardoned, A Tribune Who Wore The Narrow Stripe, And A Centurion; Who, To Clear Themselves From The Charge Of Being Concerned In Any Rebellious Project, Proved Themselves To Have Been Guilty Of Prostitution, And Consequently Incapable Of Exercising Any Influence Either Over The General Or The Soldiers.</a> <span class="flex">949</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="950">Xi. His Cruelties Were Not Only Excessive, But Subtle And Unexpected. The Day Before He Crucified A Collector Of His Rents, He Sent For Him Into His Bed-chamber, Made Him Sit Down Upon The Bed By Him, And Sent Him Away Well Pleased, And, So Far As Could Be Inferred From His Treatment, In A State Of Perfect Security; Having Vouchsafed Him The Favour Of A Plate Of Meat From His Own Table. When He Was On The Point Of Condemning To Death Aretinus Clemens, A Man Of Consular Rank, And One Of His Friends And Emissaries, He Retained Him About His Person In The Same Or Greater Favour Than Ever; Until At Last, As They Were Riding Together In The Same Litter, Upon Seeing The Man Who Had Informed Against Him, He Said, “Are You Willing That We Should Hear This Base Slave Tomorrow?” Contemptuously Abusing The Patience Of Men, He Never Pronounced A Severe Sentence Without Prefacing It  With Words Which Gave Hopes Of Mercy; So That, At Last, There Was Not A More Certain Token Of A Fatal Conclusion, Than A Mild Commencement. He Brought Before The Senate Some Persona Accused Of Treason, Declaring, “That He Should Prove That Day How Dear He Was To The Senate;” And So Influenced Them, That They Condemned The Accused To Be Punished According To The Ancient Usage . Then, As If Alarmed At The Extreme Severity Of Their Punishment, To Lessen The Odiousness Of The Proceeding, He Interposed In These Words; For It Is Not Foreign To The Purpose To Give Them Precisely As They Were Delivered: “Permit Me, Conscript Fathers, So Far To Prevail Upon Your Affection For Me, However Extraordinary The Request May Seem, As To Grant The Condemned Criminals The Favour Of Dying In The Manner They Choose. For By So Doing, Ye Will Spare Your Own Eyes, And The World Will Understand That I Interceded With The Senate On Their Behalf.”</a> <span class="flex">950</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="951">Xii. Having Exhausted The Exchequer By The Expense Of His Buildings And Public Spectacles, With The Augmentation Of Pay Lately Granted To The Troops, He Made An Attempt At The Reduction Of The Army, In Order To Lessen The Military Charges. But Reflecting, That He Should, By This Measure, Expose Himself To The Insults Of The Barbarians, While It Would Not Suffice To Extricate Him From His Embarrassments, He Had Recourse To Plundering His Subjects By Every Mode Of Exaction. The Estates Of The Living And The Dead Were Sequestered Upon Any Accusation, By Whomsoever Preferred. The Unsupported Allegation Of Any One Person, Relative To A Word Or Action Construed To Affect The Dignity Of The Emperor, Was Sufficient. Inheritances, To Which He Had Not The Slightest Pretension, Were Confiscated, If There Was Found So Much As One Person To Say, He Had Heard From The Deceased When Living, “That He Had Made The Emperor His Heir.” Besides The Exactions From Others, The Poll-tax On The Jews Was Levied With Extreme Rigour, Both On Those Who Lived After The Manner Of Jews In The City, Without Publicly Professing Themselves To Be Such , And On Those Who, By  Concealing Their Origin, Avoided Paying The Tribute Imposed Upon That People. I Remember, When I Was A Youth, To Have Been Present , When An Old Man, Ninety Years Of Age, Had His Person Exposed To View In A Very Crowded Court, In Order That, On Inspection, The Procurator Might Satisfy Himself Whether He Was Circumcised.</a> <span class="flex">951</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="953">Xiii. After He Became Emperor, He Had The Assurance To Boast In The Senate, “That He Had Bestowed The Empire On His Father And Brother, And They Had Restored It To Him.” And Upon Taking His Wife Again, After The Divorce, He Declared By Proclamation, “That He Had Recalled Her To His Pulvinar.”  He Was Not A Little Pleased Too, At Hearing The Acclamations Of The People In The Amphitheatre On A Day Of Festival, “All Happiness To Our Lord And Lady.” But When, During The Celebration Of The Capitoline Trial Of Skill, The Whole Concourse Of People Entreated Him With One Voice To Restore Palfurius Sura To His Place In The Senate, From Which He Had Been Long Before Expelled—he Having Then Carried Away The Prize Of Eloquence From All The Orators Who Had Contended For It,—he Did Not Vouchsafe To Give Them Any Answer, But Only Commanded Silence To Be Proclaimed By The Voice Of The Crier. With Equal Arrogance, When He Dictated The Form Of A Letter To Be Used By His Procurators, He Began It Thus: “Our Lord And God Commands So And So;” Whence It Became A Rule That No One Should  Style Him Otherwise Either In Writing Or Speaking. He Suffered No Statues To Be Erected For Him In The Capitol, Unless They Were Of Gold And Silver, And Of A Certain Weight. He Erected So Many Magnificent Gates And Arches, Surmounted By Representations Of Chariots Drawn By Four Horses, And Other Triumphal Ornaments, In Different Quarters Of The City, That A Wag Inscribed On One Of The Arches The Greek Word Axkei, “It Is Enough.”  He Filled The Office Of Consul Seventeen Times, Which No One Had Ever Done Before Him, And For The Seven Middle Occasions In Successive Years; But In Scarcely Any Of Them Had He More Than The Title; For He Never Continued In Office Beyond The Calends Of May [The 1St May], And For The Most Part Only Till The Ides Of January [13Th January]. After His Two Triumphs, When He Assumed The Cognomen Of Germanicus, He Called The Months Of September And October, Germanicus And Domitian, After His Own Names, Because He Commenced His Reign In The One, And Was Born In The Other.</a> <span class="flex">953</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="954">Xiv. Becoming By These Means Universally Feared And Odious, He Was At Last Taken Off By A Conspiracy Of His Friends And Favourite Freedmen, In Concert With His Wife . He Had Long Entertained A Suspicion Of The Year And Day When He Should Die, And Even Of The Very Hour And Manner Of His Death; All Which He Had Learned From The Chaldaeans, When He Was A Very Young Man. His Father Once At Supper Laughed At Him For Refusing To Eat Some Mushrooms, Saying, That If He Knew His Fate, He Would Rather Be Afraid Of The Sword. Being, Therefore, In Perpetual Apprehension And Anxiety, He Was Keenly Alive To The Slightest Suspicions, Insomuch That He Is Thought To Have Withdrawn The Edict Ordering The Destruction Of The Vines, Chiefly Because The Copies Of It Which Were Dispersed Had The Following Lines Written Upon Them:</a> <span class="flex">954</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="957">Xv. His Last Victim Was Flavius Clemens , His Cousin-german, A Man Below Contempt For His Want Of Energy, Whose Sons, Then Of Very Tender Age, He Had Avowedly Destined For His Successors, And, Discarding Their Former Names, Had Ordered One To Be Called Vespasian, And The Other Domitian. Nevertheless, He Suddenly Put Him To Death Upon Some Very Slight Suspicion , Almost Before He Was Well Out Of His Consulship. By This Violent Act He Very Much Hastened His Own Destruction. During Eight Months Together There Was So Much Lightning At Rome, And Such Accounts Of The Phaenomenon Were Brought From Other Parts, That At Last He Cried Out, “Let Him Now Strike Whom He Will.” The Capitol Was Struck By Lightning, As Well As The Temple Of The Flavian Family, With The Palatine-house, And His Own Bed-chamber. The Tablet Also, Inscribed Upon The Base Of His Triumphal Statue Was Carried Away By The Violence Of The Storm, And Fell Upon A Neighbouring  Monument. The Tree Which Just Before The Advancement Of Vespasian Had Been Prostrated, And Rose Again , Suddenly Fell To The Ground. The Goddess Fortune Of Praeneste, To Whom It Was His Custom On New Year’s Day To Commend The Empire For The Ensuing Year, And Who Had Always Given Him A Favourable Reply, At Last Returned Him A Melancholy Answer, Not Without Mention Of Blood. He Dreamt That Minerva, Whom He Worshipped Even To A Superstitious Excess, Was Withdrawing From Her Sanctuary, Declaring She Could Protect Him No Longer, Because She Was Disarmed By Jupiter. Nothing, However, So Much Affected Him As An Answer Given By Ascletario, The Astrologer, And His Subsequent Fate. This Person Had Been Informed Against, And Did Not Deny His Having Predicted Some Future Events, Of Which, From The Principles Of His Art, He Confessed He Had A Foreknowledge. Domitian Asked Him, What End He Thought He Should Come To Himself? To Which Replying, “I Shall In A Short Time Be Torn To Pieces By Dogs,” He Ordered Him Immediately To Be Slain, And, In Order To Demonstrate The Vanity Of His Art, To Be Carefully Buried. But During The Preparations For Executing This Order, It Happened That The Funeral Pile Was Blown Down By A Sudden Storm, And The Body, Half-burnt, Was Torn To Pieces By Dogs; Which Being Observed By Latinus, The Comic Actor, As He Chanced To Pass That Way, He Told It, Amongst The Other News Of The Day, To The Emperor At Supper.</a> <span class="flex">957</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="958">Xvi. The Day Before His Death, He Ordered Some Dates , Served Up At Table, To Be Kept Till The Next Day, Adding, “If I Have The Luck To Use Them.” And Turning To Those Who Were Nearest Him, He Said, “To-morrow The Moon In Aquarius Will Be Bloody Instead Of Watery, And An Event Will Happen, Which Will Be Much Talked Of All The World Over.” About Midnight, He Was So Terrified That He Leaped Out Of Bed. That Morning He Tried And Passed Sentence On A Soothsayer Sent From Germany, Who Being Consulted About The Lightning That Had Lately  Happened, Predicted From It A Change Of Government. The Blood Running Down His Face As He Scratched An Ulcerous Tumour On His Forehead, He Said, “Would This Were All That Is To Befall Me!” Then, Upon His Asking The Time Of The Day, Instead Of Five O’clock, Which Was The Hour He Dreaded, They Purposely Told Him It Was Six. Overjoyed At This Information; As If All Danger Were Now Passed, And Hastening To The Bath, Parthenius, His Chamberlain, Stopped Him, By Saying That There Was A Person Come To Wait Upon Him About A Matter Of Great Importance, Which Would Admit Of No Delay. Upon This, Ordering All Persons To Withdraw, He Retired Into His Chamber, And Was There Slain.</a> <span class="flex">958</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="959">Xvii. Concerning The Contrivance And Mode Of His Death, The Common Account Is This. The Conspirators Being In Some Doubt When And Where They Should Attack Him, Whether While He Was In The Bath, Or At Supper, Stephanus, A Steward Of Domitilla’s , Then Under Prosecution For Defrauding His Mistress, Offered Them His Advice And Assistance; And Wrapping Up His Left Arm, As If It Was Hurt, In Wool And Bandages For Some Days, To Prevent Suspicion, At The Hour Appointed, He Secreted A Dagger In Them. Pretending Then To Make A Discovery Of A Conspiracy, And Being For That Reason Admitted, He Presented To The Emperor A Memorial, And While He Was Reading It In Great Astonishment, Stabbed Him In The Groin. But Domitian, Though Wounded, Making Resistance, Clodianus, One Of His Guards, Maximus, A Freedman Of Parthenius’s, Saturius, His Principal Chamberlain, With Some Gladiators, Fell Upon Him, And Stabbed Him In Seven Places. A Boy Who Had The Charge Of The Lares In His Bed-chamber, And Was Then In Attendance As Usual, Gave These Further Particulars: That He Was Ordered By Domitian, Upon Receiving His First Wound, To Reach Him A Dagger Which Lay Under His Pillow, And Call In His Domestics; But That He Found Nothing At The Head Of The Bed, Excepting The Hilt Of A  Poniard, And That All The Doors Were Fastened: That The Emperor In The Mean Time Got Hold Of Stephanus, And Throwing Him Upon The Ground, Struggled A Long Time With Him; One While Endeavouring To Wrench The Dagger From Him, Another While, Though His Fingers Were Miserably Mangled, To Tear Out His Eyes. He Was Slain Upon The Fourteenth Of The Calends Of October [18Th Sept.], In The Forty-fifth Year Of His Age, And The Fifteenth Of His Reign . His Corpse Was Carried Out Upon A Common Bier By The Public Bearers, And Buried By His Nurse Phyllis, At His Suburban Villa On The Latin Way. But She Afterwards Privately Conveyed His Remains To The Temple Of The Flavian Family , And Mingled Them With The Ashes Of Julia, The Daughter Of Titus, Whom She Had Also Nursed.</a> <span class="flex">959</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="960">Xviii. He Was Tall In Stature, His Face Modest, And Very Ruddy; He Had Large Eyes, But Was Dim-sighted; Naturally Graceful In His Person, Particularly In His Youth, Excepting Only That His Toes Were Bent Somewhat Inward, He Was At Last Disfigured By Baldness, Corpulence, And The Slenderness Of His Legs, Which Were Reduced By A Long Illness. He Was So Sensible How Much The Modesty Of His Countenance Recommended Him, That He Once Made This Boast To The Senate, “Thus Far You Have Approved Both Of My Disposition And My Countenance.” His Baldness So Much Annoyed Him, That He Considered It An Affront To Himself, If Any Other Person Was Reproached With It, Either In Jest Or In Earnest; Though In A Small Tract He Published, Addressed To A Friend, “Concerning The Preservation Of The Hair,” He Uses For Their Mutual Consolation The Words Following:</a> <span class="flex">960</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="962">Xix. He So Shrunk From Undergoing Fatigue, That He Scarcely Ever Walked Through The City On Foot. In His  Expeditions And On A March, He Seldom Rode On Horse-back; But Was Generally Carried In A Litter. He Had No Inclination For The Exercise Of Arms, But Was Very Expert In The Use Of The Bow. Many Persons Have Seen Him Often Kill A Hundred Wild Animals, Of Various Kinds, At His Alban Retreat, And Fix His Arrows In Their Heads With Such Dexterity, That He Could, In Two Shots, Plant Them, Like A Pair Of Horns, In Each. He Would Sometimes Direct His Arrows Against The Hand Of A Boy Standing At A Distance, And Expanded As A Mark, With Such Precision, That They All Passed Between The Boy’s Fingers, Without Hurting Him.</a> <span class="flex">962</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="963">Xx. In The Beginning Of His Reign, He Gave Up The Study Of The Liberal Sciences, Though He Took Care To Restore, At A Vast Expense, The Libraries Which Had Been Burnt Down; Collecting Manuscripts From All Parts, And Sending Scribes To Alexandria , Either To Copy Or Correct Them. Yet He Never Gave Himself The Trouble Of Reading History Or Poetry, Or Of Employing His Pen Even For His Private Purposes. He Perused Nothing But The Commentaries And Acts Of Tiberius Caesar. His Letters, Speeches, And Edicts, Were All Drawn Up For Him By Others; Though He Could Converse With Elegance, And Sometimes Expressed Himself In Memorable Sentiments. “I Could Wish,” Said He Once, “That I Was But As Handsome As Metius Fancies Himself To Be.” And Of The Head Of Some One Whose Hair Was Partly Reddish, And Partly Grey, He Said, “That It Was Snow Sprinkled With Mead.”</a> <span class="flex">963</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="964">Xxi. “The Lot Of Princes,” He Remarked, “Was Very Miserable, For No One Believed Them When They Discovered A Conspiracy, Until They Were Murdered.” When He Had Leisure, He Amused Himself With Dice, Even On Days That Were Not Festivals, And In The Morning. He Went To The Bath Early, And Made A Plentiful Dinner, Insomuch That He Seldom Ate More At Supper Than A Matian Apple , To Which He Added A  Draught Of Wine, Out Of A Small Flask. He Gave Frequent And Splendid Entertainments, But They Were Soon Over, For He Never Prolonged Them After Sun-set, And Indulged In No Revel After. For, Till Bed-time, He Did Nothing Else But Walk By Himself In Private.</a> <span class="flex">964</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="965">Xxii. He Was Insatiable In His Lusts, Calling Frequent Commerce With Women, As If It Was A Sort Of Exercise, Klinopalaen, Bed-wrestling; And It Was Reported That He Plucked The Hair From His Concubines, And Swam About In Company With The Lowest Prostitutes. His Brother’s Daughter  Was Offered Him In Marriage When She Was A Virgin; But Being At That Time Enamoured Of Domitia, He Obstinately Refused Her. Yet Not Long Afterwards, When She Was Given To Another, He Was Ready Enough To Debauch Her, And That Even While Titus Was Living. But After She Had Lost Both Her Father And Her Husband, He Loved Her Most Passionately, And Without Disguise; Insomuch That He Was The Occasion Of Her Death, By Obliging Her To Procure A Miscarriage When She Was With Child By Him.</a> <span class="flex">965</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="966">Xxiii. The People Shewed Little Concern At His Death, But The Soldiers Were Roused By It To Great Indignation, And Immediately Endeavoured To Have Him Ranked Among The Gods. They Were Also Ready To Revenge His Loss, If There Had Been Any To Take The Lead. However, They Soon After Effected It, By Resolutely Demanding The Punishment Of All Those Who Had Been Concerned In His Assassination. On The Other Hand, The Senate Was So Overjoyed, That They Met In All Haste, And In A Full Assembly Reviled His Memory In The Most Bitter Terms; Ordering Ladders To Be Brought In, And His Shields And Images To Be Pulled Down Before Their Eyes, And Dashed In Pieces Upon The Floor Of The Senate-house Passing At The Same Time A Decree To Obliterate His Titles Every Where, And Abolish All Memory Of Him. A Few Months Before He Was Slain, A Raven On The Capitol Uttered These Words: “All Will Be Well.” Some Person Gave The Following Interpretation Of This Prodigy:</a> <span class="flex">966</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="988">The End Of The Twelve Caesars</a> <span class="flex">988</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="989">Lives Of Eminent Grammarians</a> <span class="flex">989</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="990">I. The Science Of Grammar  Was In Ancient Times Far From Being In Vogue At Rome; Indeed, It Was Of Little Use In A Rude State Of Society, When The People Were Engaged In Constant Wars, And Had Not Much Time To Bestow On The Cultivation Of The Liberal Arts . At The Outset, Its Pretensions Were Very Slender, For The Earliest Men Of Learning, Who Were Both Poets And Orators, May Be Considered As Half-greek: I Speak Of Livius  And Ennius , Who Are Acknowledged To Have Taught Both Languages As Well At Rome As In Foreign Parts . But They  Only Translated From The Greek, And If They Composed Anything Of Their Own In Latin, It Was Only From What They Had Before Read. For Although There Are Those Who Say That This Ennius Published Two Books, One On “Letters And Syllables,” And The Other On “Metres,” Lucius Cotta Has Satisfactorily Proved That They Are Not The Works Of The Poet Ennius, But Of Another Writer Of The Same Name, To Whom Also The Treatise On The “Rules Of Augury” Is Attributed.</a> <span class="flex">990</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="991">Ii. Crates Of Mallos , Then, Was, In Our Opinion, The First Who Introduced The Study Of Grammar At Rome. He Was Cotemporary With Aristarchus , And Having Been Sent By King Attalus As Envoy To The Senate In The Interval Between The Second And Third Punic Wars , Soon After The Death Of Ennius , He Had The Misfortune To Fall Into An Open Sewer In The Palatine Quarter Of The City, And Broke His Leg. After Which, During The Whole Period Of His Embassy And Convalescence, He Gave Frequent Lectures, Taking Much Pains To Instruct His Hearers, And He Has Left Us An Example Well Worthy Of Imitation. It Was So Far Followed, That Poems Hitherto Little Known, The Works Either Of Deceased Friends Or Other Approved Writers, Were Brought To Light, And Being Read And Commented On, Were Explained To Others. Thus, Caius Octavius Lampadio Edited The Punic War Of Naevius , Which Having Been Written In One Volume Without Any Break In The Manuscript, He Divided Into Seven Books. After That, Quintus Vargonteius Undertook The Annals Of Ennius, Which He Read On Certain Fixed Days To Crowded Audiences. So Laelius Archelaus, And Vectius Philocomus, Read And Commented On The Satires Of Their Friend Lucilius , Which Lenaeus Pompeius, A Freedman, Tells Us He Studied Under Archelaus; And Valerius Cato, Under Philocomus. Two Others Also Taught And Promoted  Grammar In Various Branches, Namely, Lucius Aelius Lanuvinus, The Son-in-law Of Quintus Aelius, And Servius Claudius, Both Of Whom Were Roman Knights, And Men Who Rendered Great Services Both To Learning And The Republic.</a> <span class="flex">991</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="992">Iii. Lucius Aelius Had A Double Cognomen, For He Was Called Praeconius, Because His Father Was A Herald; Stilo, Because He Was In The Habit Of Composing Orations For Most Of The Speakers Of Highest Rank; Indeed, He Was So Strong A Partisan Of The Nobles, That He Accompanied Quintus Metellus Numidicus  In His Exile. Servius  Having Clandestinely Obtained His Father-in-law’s Book Before It Was Published, Was Disowned For The Fraud, Which He Took So Much To Heart, That, Overwhelmed With Shame And Distress, He Retired From Rome; And Being Seized With A Fit Of The Gout, In His Impatience, He Applied A Poisonous Ointment To His Feet, Which Half-killed Him, So That His Lower Limbs Mortified While He Was Still Alive. After This, More Attention Was Paid To The Science Of Letters, And It Grew In Public Estimation, Insomuch, That Men Of The Highest Rank Did Not Hesitate In Undertaking To Write Something On The Subject; And It Is Related That Sometimes There Were No Less Than Twenty Celebrated Scholars In Rome. So High Was The Value, And So Great Were The Rewards, Of Grammarians, That Lutatius Daphnides, Jocularly Called “Pan’s Herd”  By Lenaeus Melissus, Was Purchased By Quintus Catullus For Two Hundred Thousand Sesterces, And Shortly Afterwards Made A Freedman; And That Lucius Apuleius, Who Was Taken Into The Pay Of Epicius Calvinus, A Wealthy Roman Knight, At The Annual Salary Of Ten Thousand Crowns, Had Many Scholars. Grammar Also Penetrated Into The Provinces, And Some Of The Most Eminent Amongst The Learned Taught It In Foreign Parts, Particularly In Gallia Togata. In The Number Of These, We May Reckon Octavius  Teucer, Siscennius Jacchus, And Oppius Cares , Who Persisted In Teaching To A Most Advanced Period Of His Life, At A Time When He Was Not Only Unable To Walk, But His Sight Failed.</a> <span class="flex">992</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="993">Iv. The Appellation Of Grammarian Was Borrowed From The Greeks; But At First, The Latins Called Such Persons Literati. Cornelius Nepos, Also, In His Book, Where He Draws A Distinction Between A Literate And A Philologist, Says That In Common Phrase, Those Are Properly Called Literati Who Are Skilled In Speaking Or Writing With Care Or Accuracy, And Those More Especially Deserve The Name Who Translated The Poets, And Were Called Grammarians By The Greeks. It Appears That They Were Named Literators By Messala Corvinus, In One Of His Letters, When He Says, “That It Does Not Refer To Furius Bibaculus, Nor Even To Sigida, Nor To Cato, The Literator,”  Meaning, Doubtless, That Valerius Cato Was Both A Poet And An Eminent Grammarian. Some There Are Who Draw A Distinction Between A Literati And A Literator, As The Greeks Do Between A Grammarian And A Grammatist, Applying The Former Term To Men Of Real Erudition, The Latter To Those Whose Pretensions To Learning Are Moderate; And This Opinion Orbilius Supports By Examples. For He Says That In Old Times, When A Company Of Slaves Was Offered For Sale By Any Person, It Was Not Customary, Without Good Reason, To Describe Either Of Them In The Catalogue As A Literati, But Only As A Literator, Meaning That He Was Not A Proficient In Letters, But Had A Smattering Of Knowledge.</a> <span class="flex">993</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="996">V. Saevius  Nicanor First Acquired Fame And Reputation By His Teaching: And, Besides, He Made Commentaries, The Greater Part Of Which, However, Are Said To Have Been Borrowed.

Aurelius Opilius , The Freedman Of Some Epicurean, First Taught Philosophy, Then Rhetoric, And Last Of All, Grammar.

He Also Wrote Several Volumes On A Variety Of Learned Topics, Nine Books Of Which He Distinguished By The Number And Names Of The Nine Muses; As He Says, Not Without Reason, They Being The Patrons Of Authors And Poets. I Observe That Its Title Is Given In Several Indexes By A Single Letter, But He Uses Two In The Heading Of A Book Called Pinax.</a> <span class="flex">998</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="999">Vii. Marcus Antonius Gnipho , A Free-born Native Of Gaul, Was Exposed In His Infancy, And Afterwards Received His Freedom From His Foster-father; And, As Some Say, Was Educated At Alexandria, Where Dionysius Scytobrachion  Was His Fellow Pupil. This, However, I Am Not Very Ready To Believe, As The Times At Which They Flourished Scarcely Agree. He Is Said To Have Been A Man Of Great Genius, Of Singular Memory, Well Read In Greek As Well As Latin, And Of A Most Obliging And Agreeable Temper, Who Never Haggled About Remuneration, But Generally Left It To The Liberality Of His Scholars. He First Taught In The House Of Julius Caesar , When The Latter Was Yet But A Boy, And, Afterwards, In His Own Private House. He Gave Instruction In Rhetoric Also, Teaching The Rules Of Eloquence Every Day, But Declaiming Only On Festivals. It Is Said That Some Very Celebrated Men Frequented His School,—and, Among Others, Marcus Cicero, During The Time He Held The Praetorship . He Wrote A Number Of Works, Although He Did Not Live Beyond His Fiftieth Year; But Atteius, The Philologist , Says, That He Left Only Two Volumes, “De Latino Sermone;” And, That The Other Works Ascribed To Him, Were Composed By His Disciples, And Were Not His, Although His Name Is Sometimes To Be Found In Them.</a> <span class="flex">999</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1000">Viii. M. Pompilius Andronicus, A Native Of Syria, While He Professed To Be A Grammarian, Was Considered An Idle Follower Of The Epicurean Sect, And Little Qualified To Be A Master  Of A School. Finding, Therefore, That, At Rome, Not Only Antonius Gnipho, But Even Other Teachers Of Less Note Were Preferred To Him, He Retired To Cumae, Where He Lived At His Ease; And, Though He Wrote Several Books, He Was So Needy, And Reduced To Such Straits, As To Be Compelled To Sell That Excellent Little Work Of His, “The Index To The Annals,” For Sixteen Thousand Sesterces. Orbilius Has Informed Us, That He Redeemed This Work From The Oblivion Into Which It Had Fallen, And Took Care To Have It Published With The Author’s Name.</a> <span class="flex">1000</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1001">Ix. Orbilius Pupillus, Of Beneventum, Being Left An Orphan, By The Death Of His Parents, Who Both Fell A Sacrifice To The Plots Of Their Enemies On The Same Day, Acted, At First, As Apparitor To The Magistrates. He Then Joined The Troops In Macedonia, When He Was First Decorated With The Plumed Helmet , And, Afterwards, Promoted To Serve On Horseback. Having Completed His Military Service, He Resumed His Studies, Which He Had Pursued With No Small Diligence From His Youth Upwards; And, Having Been A Professor For A Long Period In His Own Country, At Last, During The Consulship Of Cicero, Made His Way To Rome, Where He Taught With More Reputation Than Profit. For In One Of His Works He Says, That “He Was Then Very Old, And Lived In A Garret.” He Also Published A Book With The Title Of Perialogos; Containing Complaints Of The Injurious Treatment To Which Professors Submitted, Without Seeking Redress At The Hands Of Parents. His Sour Temper Betrayed Itself, Not Only In His Disputes With The Sophists Opposed To Him, Whom He Lashed On Every Occasion, But Also Towards His Scholars, As Horace Tells Us, Who Calls Him “A Flogger;”  And Domitius Marsus , Who Says Of Him:</a> <span class="flex">1001</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1004">X. Atteius, The Philologist, A Freedman, Was Born At Athens. Of Him, Capito Atteius , The Well-known Jurisconsult, Says That He Was A Rhetorician Among The Grammarians, And A Grammarian Among The Rhetoricians. Asinius Pollio , In The Book In Which He Finds Fault With The Writings Of Sallust For His Great Affectation Of Obsolete Words, Speaks Thus: “In This Work His Chief Assistant Was A Certain Atteius, A Man Of Rank, A Splendid Latin Grammarian, The Aider And Preceptor Of Those Who Studied The Practice Of Declamation; In Short, One Who Claimed For Himself The Cognomen Of Philologus.” Writing To Lucius Hermas, He Says, “That He Had Made Great Proficiency In Greek Literature, And Some In Latin; That He Had Been A Hearer Of Antonius Gnipho, And His Hermas , And Afterwards Began To Teach Others. Moreover, That He Had For Pupils Many Illustrious Youths, Among Whom Were The Two  Brothers, Appius And Pulcher Claudius; And That He Even Accompanied Them To Their Province.” He Appears To Have Assumed The Name Of Philologus, Because, Like Eratosthenes , Who First Adopted That Cognomen, He Was In High Repute For His Rich And Varied Stores Of Learning; Which, Indeed, Is Evident From His Commentaries, Though But Few Of Them Are Extant. Another Letter, However, To The Same Hermas, Shews That They Were Very Numerous: “Remember,” It Says, “To Recommend Generally Our Extracts, Which We Have Collected, As You Know, Of All Kinds, Into Eight Hundred Books.” He Afterwards Formed An Intimate Acquaintance With Caius Sallustius, And, On His Death, With Asinius Pollio; And When They Undertook To Write A History, He Supplied The One With Short Annals Of All Roman Affairs, From Which He Could Select At Pleasure; And The Other, With Rules On The Art Of Composition. I Am, Therefore, Surprised That Asinius Pollio Should Have Supposed That He Was In The Habit Of Collecting Old Words And Figures Of Speech For Sallust, When He Must Have Known That His Own Advice Was, That None But Well Known, And Common And Appropriate Expressions Should Be Made Use Of; And That, Above All Things, The Obscurity Of The Style Of Sallust, And His Bold Freedom In Translations, Should Be Avoided.</a> <span class="flex">1004</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1005">Xi. Valerius Cato Was, As Some Have Informed Us, The Freedman Of One Bursenus, A Native Of Gaul.

He Had A Great Number Of Distinguished Pupils, And Was Highly Esteemed As A Preceptor Suited To Those Who Had A Poetical Turn, As Appears From These Short Lines:</a> <span class="flex">1005</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1009">Xii.

Curtius Nicia Was The Intimate Friend Of Cneius Pompeius And Caius Memmius; But Having Carried Notes From Memmius To Pompey’s Wife , When She Was Debauched By Memmius, Pompey Was Indignant, And Forbad Him His House. He Was Also On Familiar Terms With Marcus Cicero, Who Thus Speaks Of Him In His Epistle To Dolabella : “I Have More Need Of Receiving Letters From You, Than You Have Of Desiring Them From Me. For There Is Nothing Going On At Rome In Which I Think You Would Take Any Interest, Except, Perhaps, That You May Like To Know That I Am Appointed Umpire Between Our Friends Nicias And Vidius. The One, It Appears, Alleges In Two Short Verses That Nicias Owes Him  Money; The Other, Like An Aristarchus, Cavils At Them.

Lenaeus Was A Freedman Of Pompey The Great, And Attended Him In Most Of His Expeditions. On The Death Of His Patron And His Sons, He Supported Himself By Teaching In A School Which He Opened Near The Temple Of Tellus, In The Carium, In The Quarter Of The City Where The House Of The Pompeys Stood . Such Was His Regard For His Patron’s Memory, That When Sallust Described Him As Having A Brazen Face, And A Shameless Mind, He Lashed The Historian In A Most Bitter Satire , As “A Bull’s-pizzle, A Gormandizer, A Braggart, And A Tippler, A Man Whose Life And Writings Were Equally Monstrous;” Besides Charging Him With Being “A Most Unskilful Plagiarist, Who Borrowed The Language Of Cato And Other Old Writers.” It Is Related, That, In His Youth, Having Escaped From Slavery By The Contrivance Of Some Of His Friends, He Took Refuge In His Own Country; And, That After He Had Applied Himself To The Liberal Arts, He Brought The Price Of His Freedom To His Former Master, Who, However, Struck By His Talents And Learning, Gave Him Manumission Gratuitously.</a> <span class="flex">1013</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1014">Xvi.

Then, After The Condemnation And Death Of Gallus , He Opened A School, But Had Few Pupils, And Those Very Young, Nor Any Belonging To The Higher Orders, Excepting The Children Of Those He Could Not Refuse To Admit. He Was The First, It Is Said, Who Held Disputations In Latin, And Who Began To Lecture On Virgil And The Other Modern Poets; Which The Verse Of Domitius Marcus  Points Out.</a> <span class="flex">1014</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1016">Xvii. Verrius Flaccus , A Freedman, Distinguished Himself By A New Mode Of Teaching; For It Was His Practice To Exercise The Wits Of His Scholars, By Encouraging Emulation Among Them; Not Only Proposing The Subjects On Which They Were To Write, But Offering Rewards For Those Who Were Successful In The Contest. These Consisted Of Some Ancient, Handsome, Or Rare Book. Being, In Consequence, Selected By Augustus, As Preceptor To His Grandsons, He Transferred His Entire School To The Palatium, But With The Understanding That He Should Admit No Fresh Scholars. The Hall In Catiline’s House,  Which Had Then Been Added To The Palace, Was Assigned Him For His School, With A Yearly Allowance Of One Hundred Thousand Sesterces. He Died Of Old Age, In The Reign Of Tiberius. There Is A Statue Of Him At Praeneste, In The Semi-circle At The Lower Side Of The Forum, Where He Had Set Up Calendars Arranged By Himself, And Inscribed On Slabs Of Marble.</a> <span class="flex">1016</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1017">Xviii. Lucius Crassitius, A Native Of Tarentum, And In Rank A Freedman, Had The Cognomen Of Pasides, Which He Afterwards Changed For Pansa.

C. Julius Hyginus, A Freedman Of Augustus, Was A Native Of Spain,  And That When That City Was Taken, Caesar Brought Him, Then A Boy, To Rome. He Closely And Carefully Imitated Cornelius Alexander , A Greek Grammarian, Who, For His Antiquarian Knowledge, Was Called By Many Polyhistor, And By Some History. He Had The Charge Of The Palatine Library, But That Did Not Prevent Him From Having Many Scholars; And He Was One Of The Most Intimate Friends Of The Poet Ovid, And Of Caius Licinius, The Historian, A Man Of Consular Rank , Who Has Related That Hyginus Died Very Poor, And Was Supported By His Liberality As Long As He Lived.

Finding Himself Valued And Treated As A Friend, He Preferred To Continue In His State Of Servitude, Although He Was Claimed By His Mother, Choosing Rather His Present Condition Than That Which His Real Origin Entitled Him To. In Consequence, His Freedom Was Speedily Given Him, And He Even Became A Favourite With Augustus. By His Appointment He Was Made Curator Of The Library In The Portico Of Octavia ; And, As He Himself Informs Us, Undertook To Compose, When He Was A Sexagenarian, His Books Of “Witticisms,” Which Are Now Called “The Book Of Jests.” Of These He Accomplished One Hundred And Fifty, To Which He Afterwards Added Several More. He  Also Composed A New Kind Of Story About Those Who Wore The Toga, And Called It “Trabeat.”</a> <span class="flex">1021</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1022">Xxii. Marcus Pomponius Marcellus, A Very Severe Critic Of The Latin Tongue, Who Sometimes Pleaded Causes, In A Certain Address On The Plaintiff’s Behalf, Persisted In Charging His Adversary With Making A Solecism, Until Cassius Severus Appealed To The Judges To Grant An Adjournment Until His Client Should Produce Another Grammarian, As He Was Not Prepared To Enter Into A Controversy Respecting A Solecism, Instead Of Defending His Client’s Rights. On Another Occasion, When He Had Found Fault With Some Expression In A Speech Made By Tiberius, Atteius Capito  Affirmed, “That If It Was Not Latin, At Least It Would Be So In Time To Come;” “Capito Is Wrong,” Cried Marcellus; “It Is Certainly In Your Power, Caesar, To Confer The Freedom Of The City On Whom You Please, But You Cannot Make Words For Us.” Asinius Gallus  Tells Us That He Was Formerly A Pugilist, In The Following Epigram.</a> <span class="flex">1022</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1024">Xxiii. Remmius Palaemon , Of Vicentia , The Offspring Of A Bond-woman, Acquired The Rudiments Of Learning, First As The Companion Of A Weaver’s, And Then Of His Master’s, Son, At School. Being Afterwards Made Free, He Taught At Rome, Where He Stood Highest In The Rank Of The Grammarians; But He Was So Infamous For Every Sort Of Vice, That Tiberius And His Successor Claudius Publicly Denounced Him As An Improper Person To Have The Education Of Boys And Young Men Entrusted To Him. Still, His Powers Of Narrative And Agreeable Style Of Speaking Made Him Very Popular; Besides Which, He Had The Gift Of Making Extempore Verses. He Also Wrote A Great Many In  Various And Uncommon Metres. His Insolence Was Such, That He Called Marcus Varro “A Hog;” And Bragged That “Letters Were Born And Would Perish With Him;” And That “His Name Was Not Introduced Inadvertently In The Bucolics , As Virgil Divined That A Palaemon Would Some Day Be The Judge Of All Poets And Poems.” He Also Boasted, That Having Once Fallen Into The Hands Of Robbers, They Spared Him On Account Of The Celebrity His Name Had Acquired.</a> <span class="flex">1024</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1027">Xxiv. Marcus Valerius Probus, Of Berytus , After Long Aspiring To The Rank Of Centurion, Being At Last Tired Of Waiting, Devoted Himself To Study. He Had Met With Some Old Authors At A Bookseller’s Shop In The Provinces, Where The Memory Of Ancient Times Still Lingers, And Is Not Quite Forgotten, As It Is At Rome. Being Anxious Carefully To Reperuse These, And Afterwards To Make Acquaintance With Other Works Of The Same Kind, He Found Himself An Object Of Contempt, And Was Laughed  At For His Lectures, Instead Of Their Gaining Him Fame Or Profit. Still, However, He Persisted In His Purpose, And Employed Himself In Correcting, Illustrating, And Adding Notes To Many Works Which He Had Collected, His Labours Being Confined To The Province Of A Grammarian, And Nothing More. He Had, Properly Speaking, No Scholars, But Some Few Followers. For He Never Taught In Such A Way As To Maintain The Character Of A Master; But Was In The Habit Of Admitting One Or Two, Perhaps At Most Three Or Four, Disciples In The Afternoon; And While He Lay At Ease And Chatted Freely On Ordinary Topics, He Occasionally Read Some Book To Them, But That Did Not Often Happen. He Published A Few Slight Treatises On Some Subtle Questions, Besides Which, He Left A Large Collection Of Observations On The Language Of The Ancients.</a> <span class="flex">1027</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1028">Lives Of Eminent Rhetoricians.</a> <span class="flex">1028</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1029">I.

In This Matter, They Have Decreed As Follows: ‘It Shall Be Lawful For M.

Lucius Plotius Gallus. Of Him Marcus Tullius Cicero Thus Writes To Marcus Titinnius : “I Remember Well That When We Were Boys, One Lucius Plotius First Began To Teach Latin; And As Great Numbers Flocked To His School, So That All Who Were Most Devoted To Study Were Eager To Take Lessons From Him, It Was A Great Trouble To Me That I Too Was Not Allowed To Do So. I Was Prevented, However, By The Decided Opinion  Of Men Of The Greatest Learning, Who Considered That It Was Best To Cultivate The Genius By The Study Of Greek.” This Same Gallus, For He Lived To A Great Age, Was Pointed At By M. Caelius, In A Speech Which He Was Forced To Make In His Own Cause, As Having Supplied His Accuser, Atracinus , With Materials For His Charge. Suppressing His Name, He Says That Such A Rhetorician Was Like Barley Bread  Compared To A Wheaten Loaf,—windy, Chaffy, And Coarse.</a> <span class="flex">1036</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1037">Iii.

After That, Becoming A Professor Of Rhetoric, He Gave Instructions To Cneius Pompey The Great, And Composed An Account Of His Actions, As Well As Of Those Of His Father, Being The First Freedman, According To The Opinion Of Cornelius Nepos , Who Ventured To Write History, Which Before His Time Had Not Been Done By Any One Who Was Not Of The Highest Ranks In Society.</a> <span class="flex">1037</span> </li><li><a class = "page" href="1038">Iv.

Sextus Clodius, A Native Of Sicily, A Professor Both Of Greek And Latin Eloquence, Had Bad Eyes And A Facetious Tongue.

Of His Wife, Fulvia, When There Was A Swelling In One Of Her Cheeks, He Said That “She Tempted The Point Of His Style;”  Nor Did Antony Think Any The Worse Of Him For The Joke, But Quite Enjoyed It; And Soon Afterwards, When Antony Was Consul , He Even Made Him A Large Grant Of Land, Which Cicero Charges Him With In His Philippics . “You Patronize,” He Said, “A Master Of The Schools For The Sake Of His Buffoonery, And Make A Rhetorician One Of Your Pot-companions; Allowing Him To Cut His Jokes On Any One He Pleased; A Witty Man, No Doubt, But It Was An Easy Matter To Say Smart Things Of Such As You And Your Companions. But Listen, Conscript Fathers, While I Tell You What Reward Was Given To This Rhetorician, And Let The Wounds Of The Republic Be Laid Bare To View. You Assigned Two Thousand Acres Of The Leontine Territory  To Sextus Clodius, The Rhetorician, And Not Content With That, Exonerated The Estate From All Taxes.

There He Was Admitted To Fellowship, And Lodged, With Plancus The Orator , Whose Practice It Was, Before He Made A Speech In Public, To Set Up Some One To Take The Contrary Side In The Argument. The Office Was Undertaken By Albutius With Such Success, That He Silenced Plancus, Who Did Not Venture To Put Himself In Competition With Him. This Bringing Him Into Notice, He Collected An Audience Of His Own, And It Was His Custom To Open The Question Proposed For Debate, Sitting; But As He Warmed With The Subject, He Stood Up, And Made His Peroration In That Posture. His Declamations Were Of Different Kinds; Sometimes Brilliant And Polished, At Others, That They Might Not Be Thought To Savour Too Much Of The Schools, He Curtailed Them Of All Ornament, And Used Only Familiar Phrases.
